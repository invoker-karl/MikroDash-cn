// B.0b of Collectors-Rewrite.md: HOW MANY CONCURRENT CHANNELS DOES ONE ROUTER
// TOLERATE.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM B.0 ───────────────────────────────
//
// B.0 asked what one WIDE channel costs, and answered it: streaming thirty
// interfaces instead of two is 2.6 KB/s, one channel either way, no measurable
// CPU. The finding that dissolved that trade was "one stream is one channel
// whether its comma list holds two interfaces or thirty".
//
// Track B now proposes something B.0 never measured. The operator's rule is that
// every collector offers Stream and Poll, and twenty collectors declare a
// `streamKey`. Twenty subscribed collectors on a watched router is TWENTY
// PERMANENTLY OPEN CHANNELS -- against the bottleneck this project documents as
// concurrent channels, and which `internal/roslimit` caps at eight for COMMANDS.
//
// That cap does not protect against this and does not measure it: `reader.Do`
// takes a slot and `reader.Stream` does not. So the number is unknown, and every
// step after B.0b depends on it.
//
// ── WHAT IT MEASURES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Channels are opened one at a time on ONE connection, which is how the app
// works -- every collector for a router shares a session's client, and each
// stream is one tag on it. At each width:
//
//	does the next channel OPEN            a refusal is the hard ceiling
//	the router's CPU                      against a no-channel control
//	rows/s on the FIRST channel           the quiet failure: a router that
//	                                      accepts a channel and then starves the
//	                                      ones already open would look fine at
//	                                      every width and be broken at all of them
//
// The third is the one worth the tool. A ceiling announces itself; degradation
// does not, and a collector delivering half its rows renders a page that is
// merely stale rather than one that is empty.
//
// READ-ONLY. It opens monitor channels and closes them, and writes nothing.
