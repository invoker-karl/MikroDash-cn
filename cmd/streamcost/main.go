// streamcost is B.0 of Collectors-Rewrite.md: measure what it would cost to
// stream EVERY interface, before designing anything on top of the idea.
//
// ── THE QUESTION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `ifStatus` takes interface rates as a MEASUREMENT — /interface/monitor-traffic
// with a once argument, on every interface, every poll. It is roughly 52
// commands a minute and the largest single item left on an idle router.
//
// `traffic` already holds an open channel on the same menu, for the handful of
// interfaces someone is watching. If that channel covered EVERY interface,
// `ifStatus` could read its rates from it and stop measuring, removing the 52
// outright.
//
// That inverts `traffic`'s stated design — its header says "a router with forty
// interfaces is not forty streams" and its subscription set is refcounted so the
// stream shrinks when viewers leave. So it is a real trade, and the plan says to
// measure it rather than argue it.
//
// ── WHAT THIS MEASURES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ───────────────────
//
// It measures the ROUTER side: rows and bytes per second pushed down one channel
// at the full interface count, against the same channel at the count `traffic`
// uses today. Those are the two numbers the design turns on and neither can be
// got from the code.
//
// It also samples the ROUTER'S CPU while each channel is open. The plan did not
// ask for that number and it is the one that actually decides the question:
// bandwidth is not this app's bottleneck and never was -- "the evidence in #104
// points at concurrent open channels rather than data volume" -- so the only way
// streaming thirty interfaces can be expensive is if PRODUCING thirty sections a
// second costs the router something.
//
// It does NOT measure the fan-out cost in this process. That is a Go question
// with a Go answer, and it is dominated by whatever this prints.
//
// READ-ONLY. Two monitor channels, opened and closed. It writes nothing.
