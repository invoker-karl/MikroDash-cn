// Every rule compares a reading against a threshold AND against its own previous
// verdict, firing only on the TRANSITION. `system:update` arrives about every
// two seconds, so a rule that fired on the LEVEL would page the operator
// continuously while a CPU stayed busy. The alert-eval corpus pins it:
// `cpuGoesHighAndStaysHigh` fires once across four readings, and a level-testing
// port passes every other CPU case.
//
// ── WHAT IS HERE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ──────────────────────────────
//
// Everything except the BGP family: the CPU rule, the RouterOS update check,
// ping loss, host reachability, interface up/down and VPN peers. BGP is not
// ported; the corpus records them as uncovered BY NAME, and its
// generator fails if a family appears in the live evaluator that is in neither
// list. A green suite here does not mean the evaluator is ported.
//
// ── AND NOTHING CALLS THIS YET, ON PURPOSE ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Wiring an evaluator to the notification transports is a CUTOVER step: both
// apps would evaluate the same conditions against the same routers, and the
// cooldown is an in-memory map rather than a shared row, so every alert would be
// sent twice. `internal/notify/send.go` carries the reasoning; the port record
// Part 25 records it.
