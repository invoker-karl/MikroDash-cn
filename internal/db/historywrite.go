// The history tables' WRITE side: the four inserts `internal/history` produces
// rows for and nothing has ever performed.
//
// ── THIS IS CUTOVER CODE, AND IT IS CALLED BY NOBODY ON PURPOSE ────────────
//
// `internal/history` holds `Writer` (which buckets per-second traffic and ping
// samples into the minute rows these tables take) and `Connectivity`. Both are
// complete and pinned, and both are constructed by nobody — because two
// processes bucketing the same samples into one SQLite file would DOUBLE every
// row, and during coexistence Node is the one doing it.
//
// the port record's cutover checklist lists starting them as step 0: code that
// must exist and be tested BEFORE the window rather than discovered inside it.
// This is that code's other half.
//
// Verified absent by MEASUREMENT on 2026-08-29 rather than by grep — with a
// session connected and its collectors running, all four tables gained zero rows
// in eighty seconds.
//
// ── ONE ROW TYPE, FOUR TABLES, AND THE COLUMNS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE ─────
//
// `history.Row` carries `RxOrRTT`/`TxOrLoss` because a traffic row and a ping row
// have the same shape and different meanings. The mapping is taken from
// `src/db.js:670-674` verbatim:
//
//	traffic       (router_id, interface, rx_mbps, tx_mbps, ts)
//	bandwidth     (router_id, interface, rx_mb,   tx_mb,   ts)
//	ping          (router_id, target,    rtt_ms,  loss_pct, ts)
//	connectivity  (router_id, connected, ts)
//
// Mixing `rx_mbps` and `rx_mb` is the error this mapping exists to prevent: they
// are a RATE and a VOLUME, differing by a factor of the sampling interval, and a
// swap renders as a plausible-looking chart with wrong numbers.

// PersistHistory writes one batch of bucketed rows.
//
// ── ONE TRANSACTION FOR THE BATCH ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A minute rollover emits one row per interface plus one per ping target, and
// they all describe the same minute. Committing them separately lets a reader
// see half a minute's interfaces — and Reports aggregates BY minute, so a
// partial minute renders as a dip in a chart rather than as a visible error.
//
// RETURNS THE COUNT WRITTEN, so a caller can log honestly rather than assume.
