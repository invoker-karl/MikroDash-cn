// The backup history's two writes.
//
// Kept apart from backups.go because that file's header promises it does not
// write — the same split history.go and schedule_write.go already use, for the
// reason that file gives: a promise contradicted three functions later is worse
// than no promise.
//
// ── PRUNING AND DELETING WERE DIFFERENT ACTS, AND ARE NOW ONE ───────────────
//
// `MarkBackupPruned` was RETENTION: MikroDash aged a pair out on its own, so the
// artefacts went and THE ROW STAYED, letting the History table explain the
// disappearance rather than have the pair vanish from the list.
//
// One sentence of explanation, at the price of a row per router per day for
// ever — and nothing else ever read those rows. Restore, download, raw-serving
// and diff each refuse a pruned row, and the scheduler's `LastBackupRun` cannot
// see one because retention always spares the newest run. Worse, the row went on
// reporting the outcome of the day it ran: a green "Stored" badge and the size
// of a file that had not existed for weeks.
//
// `DeleteBackup` is an OPERATOR saying "I do not want this listed", and is now
// also what retention calls, because it is the same act: the pair is gone and
// the record of it has nothing left to describe. `backups.PruneStore.ForgetRow`
// is the seam, and `PurgePrunedBackups` clears what older builds marked.
//
// AND THE CLAIM THAT MADE THIS SAFE WAS FALSE. It read: "audit_events
// independently records the backup.run that created a pair and the
// backup.delete that removed it, and that table is deliberately absent from
// PURGE_TABLES and from deleteRouterData(), which is what makes it the one place
// hard to erase." The second half still holds. The first half was true only of
// MANUAL runs — every `backup.run` event came from the Backups page — so on an
// install with a schedule the trail recorded almost none of them. Measured on a
// real install: 7 events against 19 recorded runs. `runScheduledBackup` writes
// one now, which is what makes removing the row safe rather than merely tidy.

// Retention used to mark a row and keep it; it deletes now. Rows marked by a

//
// ONE-OFF AND IDEMPOTENT: afterwards nothing has `pruned_at` set, and nothing
// sets it again. Called from `cmd/mikrodash` rather than from `Open`, for the
// reason every migration here is: `cmd/compat` opens a real /data through a
// READ-ONLY mount, and a write in Open would fail the one tool whose job is to
// read a production directory untouched.
