// The DAILY RETENTION SWEEP — `prune()` and `startPruneInterval` in `src/db.js`.
//
// ── THE PORT HAD NONE, AND THE SETTINGS PAGE SAID OTHERWISE ────────────────
//
// `dbRetentionDays`, `dbAlertRetentionDays` and `dbAuditRetentionDays` are
// rendered by the Settings page, validated by the write route and persisted —
// and until 2026-08-29 nothing in this port ever read one. An operator could set
// a retention policy that did nothing while the database grew without bound.
//
// The third instance in two days of one shape: a setting rendered, validated,
// persisted, never consumed. The other two were the operator's own reports
// (`topN`, and `topTalkersN` beside it). This one was found by counting the
// class out of the generated settings table rather than waiting to be told.
//
// ── IT IS NOT `purge.go` ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `purge.go` is the operator-triggered cleanup card: it deletes by ROUTER, on
// demand, and deliberately excludes `audit_events`. This deletes by AGE, on a
// timer, across the whole install — and `audit_events` is in it, because age is
// the only thing allowed to remove an audit row.
//
// ── THE MAPPING IS LIFTED, NOT RETYPED ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The db-prune corpus reads the six DELETEs and three cutoffs out of the
// live `prune()`, and `prune_test.go` asserts this file against them. Two of the
// six are exactly the sort a retyped table gets wrong:
//
//   - `alert_events` keys on `fired_at`. The other five use `ts`.
//   - `connectivity_events` ages on the ALERT retention despite its column being
//     `ts` like the metrics. Aging it with the metrics would throw away a year
//     of connectivity history under a 90-day metric policy — and that is the
//     table the Reports page's outage view is drawn from.
//
// ── ZERO MEANS "DEFAULT", NOT "KEEP NOTHING" ──────────────────────────────
//
// The live cutoffs are `(retentionDays || 90) * 86400000`. A missing OR ZERO
// setting takes the default, so a settings file that has never had the field
// written keeps 90 days rather than deleting everything. Reproduced exactly:
// this is a delete path, and getting it backwards is unrecoverable.

	Alert  int

	if v <= 0 {
		return fallback
	}
	return v
}

// MetricDays, AlertDays and AuditDays resolve one policy each, applying the live
// fallback. EXPORTED because the audit row records the RESOLVED number: a row
// written against an unwritten settings file must say 90, the value that
// actually governed the delete, not the 0 that was stored.

// pruneRules is the six DELETEs, in the live order.
//
// ORDER IS PRESERVED because the log line reports one total, and a reader
// comparing it against the live app's should not have to reconcile two
// orderings. It has no effect on the result.
