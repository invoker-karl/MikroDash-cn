// The two feeds the notification bell reads.
//
// ── THE RULE THAT KEPT THESE UNPORTED, AND HOW IT WAS HONOURED ──────────────
//
// `alerts.go` records it: "a read nothing calls is a read nothing gates", and
// warns that porting a query ahead of its caller adds code no corpus drives and
// no gate covers. That rule is not waived here — it is satisfied. These land
// WITH the alertfeed corpus, which seeds a database, runs the LIVE queries
// against it and records both the rows and the answers, so there is no window in
// which they exist and nothing exercises them. The bell (queue item 14) is the
// production caller and follows.

// AlertRow is one row of either feed.
//
// Subject, Detail, ResolvedAt, AcknowledgedAt and AcknowledgedBy are POINTERS
// because every one of them is nullable and the difference is visible: an
// unacknowledged alert with a zero timestamp would render as "seen at the epoch"
// rather than as unseen.

	Subject        *string `json:"subject"`

// zero is falsy in JavaScript — so a caller passing 0 gets 200 rows, not none. A
// port passing the zero through to SQL returns an empty feed and the bell
// silently shows nothing, which looks exactly like "no alerts".

// ── "RECENT" MEANS RESOLVED, NOT LATELY ─────────────────────────────────────

// An alert that is still open is never in this feed, however recently it fired.
// Reading "recent" as "lately" would put every open alert in both lists and the
// bell would count each of them twice.
//
// ── AND IT SORTS ON A DIFFERENT COLUMN FROM OpenAlerts ──────────────────────
//
// `resolved_at DESC`, not `fired_at DESC`. The two disagree whenever an alert
// fires early and resolves late: it outranks one that fired late and resolved
// early. Sorting on the wrong column produces a list that looks plausible and is
// backwards, which is why the corpus carries exactly that pair — and refuses to
// pass if the seed cannot tell the two orders apart.
//
// `sinceTS` is compared with `>=`, so a row resolved exactly at the boundary is
// included.
