// B.1 of Collectors-Rewrite.md: a SECOND WAY OF FILLING AN ENTRY.
//
// ── THE ASSUMPTION THIS FILE EXISTS TO RETIRE ───────────────────────────────
//
// This cache was built for queries, and the shared-menu ledger recorded
// `/interface/monitor-traffic` as unroutable because "one side holds a stream,
// the other takes a bounded measurement; a by-menu cache would hand one the
// other's answer". True of the cache as it was. Not true of caching.
//
// The operator's challenge, 2026-09-09: "any stream here is simply the router
// controlling the rate of data arriving using =interval=N; a slow poll to the
// same endpoint would yield the same fields at a slower rate. So why not use
// cache?"
//
// It survives. The scheduler is only ONE filler:
//
//	poll     Scheduler tick -> Invalidate -> Get -> deliver(rows) -> onRows
//	stream   the router pushes ->            store -> deliver(rows) -> onRows
//	                                                  ^ the same seam
//
// `Cache.deliver` and `Subscribe`'s `onRows` are already the fan-out. A stream
// is a filler for an entry collectors already subscribe to, so a collector does
// not change at all to gain a stream path.
//
// ── THE BOUNDARY IS NOT QUERY-VERSUS-STREAM. IT IS WHAT A ROW MEANS ─────────
//
// A stream can back an entry when its rows are successive READINGS of a keyed
// value. It cannot when each row is a distinct element that matters:
//
//	/interface/monitor-traffic   a fresh reading per interface     ROLLABLE
//	any /print =interval=N       a re-print of the whole table     ROLLABLE
//	/tool/ping                   a distinct measurement; the collector counts
//	                             EVERY row into min/max/avg/loss   NOT ROLLABLE
//	/log/listen                  a distinct event                  NOT ROLLABLE
//
// Getting that wrong fails SILENTLY -- 0% loss for ever, dropped log lines, and
// nothing red anywhere. `unrollable` below is the gate, and it refuses rather
// than warns.
//
// ── NO SWEEP BOUNDARY, WHICH IS THE TRAP AVOIDED RATHER THAN SOLVED ────────
//
// `monitor-traffic` with a comma list pushes one row per interface per interval
// and sends no `!done` between rounds, so "wait for a complete sweep" has no
// signal to wait on. A ROLLING MAP has no boundary to detect: each row replaces
// its own key and the entry is always current.
//
// `snapshot` returns the values SORTED BY KEY. That is not tidiness: collectors
// fingerprint their payloads to suppress redundant emits, and an unstable order
// would make every payload look changed and defeat the dirty check.

// A DENYLIST AND NOT A JUDGEMENT AT THE CALL SITE. The failure is invisible --

// still passes -- so the decision belongs somewhere a person has to edit

	// ── KIND TWO WAS HERE AND IS NOW EMPTY ─────────────────────────────────
	//
	// It has been narrowed twice by measurement rather than by argument, and
	// both narrowings are worth keeping because each was a real obstacle:
	//
	//	FIRST it was CHURN. The entry could only accumulate, so a row that left
	//	the table never left the map -- closed connections, departed clients and
	//	expired leases piling up for the life of the session. B.6 found the round
	//	boundary (a repeated key, or a gap longer than the cadence) and that
	//	reason went. The connection table came off the list.
	//
	//	THEN it was EMPTINESS. A table with no rows sends nothing, and nothing is
	//	indistinguishable from a dead channel, so an emptied table held its last
	//	contents. The watchdog turned out to already run the distinguishing
	//	experiment: it reopens a quiet channel, and silence that survives a
	//	deliberate reopen is evidence of an empty table rather than a broken one.
	//	See the rule in `watch`.
	//
	// So no menu is refused for either reason now. The list above -- rows that
	// are not readings of one value -- is the one that remains, and it is
	// permanent: it is a fact about what a ping result and a log line ARE.

// ── WHY SHARING NEEDED A SECOND ENTRY POINT ────────────────────────────────
//
// `FillFromStream` is single-owner and refuses a second caller, deliberately:
// two collectors quietly fighting over one channel is a whole class of bug, and
// thirteen of the fourteen streamed menus have exactly one consumer.
//
// `/interface/monitor-traffic` has two, and they want different things.
// `ifStatus` wants every enabled interface at its own cadence and reads a
// SNAPSHOT; `traffic` wants the interfaces somebody is watching — which may
// include a disabled one — at one second, and needs EVERY ROW as it arrives to
// fan out to per-interface rooms. Neither set contains the other, so this is a
// merge and not a subscription to somebody else's channel.
//
// ── THE MERGE IS THE CALLER'S, AND THAT IS THE POINT ───────────────────────
//
// `=interface=` is a comma list and `=interval=` is a minimum. Neither rule
// belongs in a cache that knows nothing about menus, and putting them here
// would make the next shared menu's rule the second special case. So holders
// declare what they want, this package keeps the set, and `Merge` — supplied by
// the caller and identical for every holder of one menu — turns the set into
// the command the channel is opened with.

// rows in 3s for 3 configured hosts, `/ip/dns/print` 4 rows for 1. Three
// re-prints, no separator.
//
// Without a boundary the entry can only ever accumulate, and a row that LEAVES
// the table never leaves the map -- closed connections, departed clients and
// expired leases pile up for the life of the session, on a page that looks
// populated. That is why every churning menu was refused.
//
// TWO SIGNALS, because neither is sufficient alone:
//
//	A KEY REPEATS   the round has restarted. Reliable precisely because the
//	                re-print is total: every row still present appears in every
//	                round, so a repeat is certain unless the entire membership
//	                turned over at once. This is the signal that works when the
//	                table is large enough that rounds arrive back to back with no
//	                gap between them.
//	A QUIET GAP     nothing for longer than the cadence. This is what ends the
//	                round for a small table, where the rows arrive in a burst and

// That is a far smaller error than the unbounded growth it replaces, and it is
// bounded by the next row rather than by the session. It is still an error, and

// MEASURED: the DHCP page read "0 leases" and "No DHCP networks on this device"

// exists and self-corrects in a second, which is exactly why it would have been
