// Package roscache coalesces RouterOS reads, so two collectors asking the same
// menu in the same moment cost ONE command against the router.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Measured across `internal/collect`: 72 distinct RouterOS commands, 98 issued
// per full sweep, so 26 are redundant. Eighteen menus have more than one
// consumer — `/interface/wifi/registration-table` has four, `/ip/address` has
// three, `/ip/firewall/connection` has two that ask for the IDENTICAL fields.
//
// CLAUDE.md states the constraint this is written against: "more efficient means
// fewer router channels, not faster payload assembly". A hAP ac2 does not care
// about this process's memory; it cares how many API channels are open on it.
// So when a wider proplist on one round trip competes with two narrow ones, the
// single round trip wins every time, and this package is built on that trade.
//
// ── THE UNION PROPLIST, AND THE TRAP IN IT ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Consumers of one menu rarely want identical fields; usually one asks for a
// subset of another. The cache fetches the UNION and hands everyone the same
// rows, which is why one read can serve all of them.
//
// The trap: a consumer arriving later with a field nobody asked for widens the
// union, and the value already cached was fetched WITHOUT that field. Returning
// it would hand the newcomer rows silently missing the column it asked for —
// a wrong answer, not a slow one. Widening therefore INVALIDATES, and the next
// Get refetches. This costs one extra read on the first sweep after a new
// consumer appears and nothing thereafter.
//
// ── ROWS ARE SHARED AND MUST NOT BE MUTATED ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `routeros.Reply` is a `map[string]string`. Copying every row for every
// consumer would trade the router channels we just saved for allocations and
// garbage, which is the wrong direction on a box already doing this work for a
// fleet. So the same slice, and the same maps inside it, are handed to every
// caller.
//
// That is a real hazard and it is guarded rather than hoped for: one consumer
// writing to a row it was handed would corrupt every other consumer of that
// menu, and it would surface as an unrelated page showing wrong data. See
// TestRowsAreSharedNotCopied, which pins the sharing, and the note on Get.
