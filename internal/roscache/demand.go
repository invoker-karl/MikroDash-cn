// The demand set: who currently wants which menu, and how fresh.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Today a collector owns a timer and decides for itself whether to read, and
// five separate gates decide whether that decision counts. Phase 3 of
// Collectors-Rewrite.md inverts it: a query runs if and only if something
// currently wants it, and "should this run" has ONE answer instead of five.
//
// This file is the bookkeeping half. It records demand and computes what the
// active set is. It fetches nothing: the scheduler that consumes this arrives in
// 3.2, and until then the cache stays purely pull-driven through Get.
//
// ── SET A ONLY, AND THAT IS NOT AN OMISSION ─────────────────────────────────
//
// A subscription is keyed by menu and field list, which is a TABLE READ's key.
// Measurements and streams -- interface rates, pings, the log listener -- are
// keyed by their target and their moment, and a stream has no result to key at
// all. They are not modelled here and must not be forced in: collapsing both
// behind one abstraction is exactly what made phase 1's first premise wrong. See
// `internal/collect/acquisition.go`.
//
// ── THE UNION MUST SHRINK, WHICH IS NEW ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// `entry.widen` never shrinks, and that is right for what it serves: the callers
// of Get are collectors that live as long as the session, so their union only
// grows because their number only grows.
//
// SUBSCRIPTIONS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY. They come and go with pages and viewers,
// so a monotonic union would mean a page opened once and closed makes every later
// read of that menu carry its columns for ever. So this keeps each subscriber's
// fields and recomputes the union when one leaves.
//
// That is why there is a subscriber LIST here and not the bare per-menu refcount
// the plan's Go note suggests. A count cannot shrink a union. What the note is
// really protecting is the hot path, and that is untouched: `Get` never reads any
// of this, so a subscription change cannot contend with a read.

// An empty field list means "every field", and a zero cadence means "no cadence

// whatever others keep fresh can say so. That mirrors the zero TTL rule at
