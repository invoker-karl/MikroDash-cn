// The `settings:pages` payload: what every browser learns about which pages it
// may draw and which notification toggles are on.
//
// ── THE KEY LIST IS DERIVED UPSTREAM, SO IT IS NOT WRITTEN HERE ─────────────
//
// `_PAGE_SETTING_KEYS` is one key per page from the page table, five named keys,
// `userNotifyEnabled`, and every `notif*` DEFAULT that holds a BOOLEAN. It
// therefore grows from two different files, and a hand-copied list here would
// stop carrying a new key silently. That failure is not a crash: the browser
// gets the payload without the key, `applyPageVisibility` reads it as absent,
// and a page the operator can enable in the form stays hidden with nothing
// logged.
//
// So the list is EMBEDDED from `pagekeys.json`, which the settings-pages corpus
// lifts out of the live source.
//
// ── THE BOOLEAN FILTER IS A DISCLOSURE BOUNDARY, NOT A TIDINESS RULE ────────
//
// `notifTitle`, `notifBody` and `notifCooldownSec` all match `/^notif/` and are
// excluded because they are not booleans. Filtering by name would broadcast the
// operator's notification message text to every connected browser.

// ── AN ABSENT KEY IS OMITTED; AN EXPLICIT NULL IS KEPT ──────────────────────
//
// The live projection is `out[k] = src[k]`, which writes the key whatever the
// source holds — so a key the file does not have is PRESENT in the object with
// the value `undefined`, and `JSON.stringify` then drops it. What reaches the
// browser omits it.
//
// A key holding null is different: JSON keeps that. So the two cases have to be
// distinguished, and in Go that means the two-value map lookup — `src[k]` alone
// yields the same nil for both, and emitting null for an absent key would send
// something JavaScript never sends, breaking `pages[k] === undefined` on the
// client.
//
// This is the SECOND place in the port where Go's one-value lookup conflates
// JavaScript's `undefined` and `null`; the first was `collection.PollRetunes`,
// where it silently sped up a collector whose interval had never been written.
//
// FALSY VALUES SURVIVE. `false`, `0` and `""` are the "off" states, and a
// projection using `||` or skipping empty values would drop exactly the settings
// an operator turned off.
