// Package store reads MikroDash's existing on-disk state.
//
// PHASE B2, AND THE SECOND KILL CRITERION. The Go build must read the /data
// directory the Node build wrote, byte for byte. Get the key derivation subtly
// wrong and settings decrypt to empty strings; get the password hashing subtly
// wrong and every user is locked out of their own dashboard. Neither failure is
// loud, which is why there is a round-trip verifier (cmd/compat) rather than a
// hopeful comment.
//
// THREE PLACES THIS IS EASY TO GET WRONG, all verified against the Node source:
//
//  1. THE SALT IS A STRING, NOT DECODED BYTES. Node calls
//     scrypt(password, salt, ...) with `salt` as a JS string, so the salt is the
//     UTF-8 bytes OF THAT STRING. A user's salt is stored as 64 hex characters,
//     and the temptation is to hex-decode it to 32 bytes. That produces a
//     different key and rejects every correct password.
//
//  2. THE ENVELOPE IS iv‖tag‖ciphertext, and Go's AES-GCM Open expects
//     ciphertext‖tag. The tag sits in the MIDDLE of what Node wrote, so it has
//     to be moved before Open sees it.
//
//  3. users.json MUST STAY A BARE JSON ARRAY. MikroDash's CLAUDE.md documents
//     this as a security property, not a preference: `_readFile()` returns [] for
//     anything that is not an array, so a version wrapper would make a
//     rolled-back binary read ZERO users — which re-opens POST /api/users/setup,
//     an unauthenticated route, and lets anyone who can reach the instance claim
//     it. This package therefore only ever reads that shape, and any writer added
//     later must preserve it.
