// CoerceRouterPatch types a `PUT /api/routers/:id` patch the way the live
// `updateRouter` does, for the keys the patch actually names.
//
// ── WITHOUT IT, ONE BAD FIELD MAKES THE WHOLE FLEET DISAPPEAR ──────────────
//
// `UpdateRouter` is a shallow patch that writes what it is given. `Router` has
// typed fields — `port int`, `tls`/`tlsInsecure`/`disabled`/`alertsEnabled bool`,
// the two bandwidth ints — and `Routers()` decodes routers.json into
// `[]Router` in ONE Unmarshal. So a single string where a bool belongs does not
// spoil one record; it fails the decode and returns ZERO ROUTERS.
//
// Measured 2026-08-29: writing `{"disabled":"false"}` through the update path
// left routers.json holding the string, after which `Routers()` answered
// `0 routers` and `json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field
// Router.disabled of type bool`. Every page, session and collector reads that
// call. A well-formed API request from an authorised operator takes the fleet
// out until somebody hand-edits the file.
//
// The live app cannot do this: every field on its update path goes through a
// coercion (`!!(data.disabled)`, `parseInt(data.port, 10)`, …), so routers.json
// only ever holds the right types. This is that field block, for the keys
// present in the patch — an ABSENT key is untouched, which is what makes it a
// patch rather than a rewrite.
//
// ── THE EXPRESSIONS ARE LIVE'S, NOT TIDIER VERSIONS OF THEM ────────────────
//
// `tls` is true unless the value is literal false or the string "false". Every
// OTHER boolean here is `_isTrue` — the exact word or the string "true", and
// nothing else.
//
// ── AND THAT CHANGED UPSTREAM ON 2026-08-29, IN THIS PORT'S FAVOUR ─────────
//
// This block used to reproduce THREE different coercions, because live had
// three: `tlsInsecure` was `=== true || === 'true'` (`dccbf62`) while `disabled`
// and `alertsEnabled` were plain `!!` truthiness — under which the four
// characters "false" are TRUE. The note here said reproducing all three was
// deliberate and that the divergence was reported rather than fixed
// unilaterally.
//
// `dd6173b` is the reply: the port enumerated the class after `dccbf62` fixed
// the instance, and found three survivors. Upstream's own summary of the worst
// of them — "PUT with disabled: 'false' is an operator ENABLING a router. The
// truthiness form read it as true and disabled it, tearing the session down —
// the opposite of what was asked, on the field that decides whether a device is
// monitored at all." All six live sites now go through one `_isTrue`, so this
// block follows and there is one rule again.
//
// `tls` still does not, on both sides, and the reason is not tidiness: it
// defaults to ON, so its question is "not false and not 'false'" — a different
// question whose SAFE direction is the opposite one. Two rules, deliberately.
//
// Junk (`'1'`, `'yes'`, `'on'`, an object) is false everywhere, which for
// `disabled` means the conservative direction is leaving the router in service.
