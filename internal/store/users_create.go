// `createUser` — appending a user to users.json.
//
// ── THE SECOND WRITE THIS PORT MAKES TO THAT FILE ───────────────────────────
//
// `users_write.go` changes an existing user's password. This one adds a record,
// and it exists for `POST /api/users/setup`: the UNAUTHENTICATED route that
// mints the first administrator of a fresh install. That route is reachable only
// when the file holds zero users, so it is a cutover-only path — and it is also
// the single most consequential write in the application, which is what shapes
// everything below.
//
// ── A STRUCT, NOT A MAP, AND FOR ONE REASON ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Everywhere else in this package a record is `map[string]any`, because a writer
// that decodes into a struct it did not define rewrites the parts of the
// document it does not know about. That argument does not apply here: this
// record does not exist yet, so there is nothing to preserve.
//
// The positive reason is key ORDER. Go sorts map keys and `JSON.stringify` does
// not, which `internal/store/jsonwrite.go` records as a known difference — but a
// STRUCT encodes in field-declaration order, so the seven fields below reach
// disk in exactly the order `users.js` writes them. This is the one place the
// port can close that gap for free, so it is closed.
//
// The order is neither decorative nor guessed: the users-create corpus
// RUNS the live `createUser` against a throwaway directory and records the key
// order of the file it produced.
//
// ── VALIDATION THROWS; IT DOES NOT DEFAULT ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `_validRole` refuses an unrecognised role AND an absent one, and writes
// nothing. `rbac.PlanUserGrants` maps an unrecognised role to `viewer` instead.
// Both are deliberate — validation at the write boundary, least privilege at the
// read boundary — and a port sharing one helper between them would either refuse
// a user the live app creates or create one it refuses.
//
// The live comment says why the throw exists: both call sites once read
// `role === 'viewer' ? 'viewer' : 'admin'`, so ANY unrecognised value became an
// administrator — "a typo, a stale client, or a role added later and not yet
// wired up here".
