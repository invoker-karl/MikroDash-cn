// What `Routers.getPublic()` discloses.
//
// ── THE PORT WAS SENDING ELEVEN FIELDS OF TWENTY-THREE ──────────────────────
//
// Found by live verification on 2026-08-28: the Go server and Node were asked
// for `/api/routers` with the same cookie against the same /data, and the port's
// answer was missing twelve keys —
//
//	addedAt  alertsEnabled  backup  connDownThresholdSec  geo  model
//	osVersion  password  pingTarget  serial  siteId  tlsInsecure
//
// — because `Routers()` decodes the file into `store.Router`, which models
// eleven, and an undeclared key is dropped. The consequences are concrete: the
// Routers page shows `model` and `osVersion`, and the Add/Edit modal reads
// `pingTarget`, `tlsInsecure`, `backup` and `geo`, so it would seed defaults and
// a save would write them over the operator's values.
//
// This is the failure `users_public.go`'s header describes — "a writer that
// decodes into a struct it did not define rewrites the parts of the document it
// does not know about" — in the READ direction, on another endpoint. Hence the
// same answer: read the raw records and strip a denylist of two.
//
// ── THE LIVE FUNCTION IS FOUR LINES AND NONE IS A FIELD LIST ────────────────
//
//	const out = { ...r, password: r.password ? MASK : '' };
//	if (r.backup) {
//	  const { password, ...rest } = r.backup;
//	  out.backup = { ...rest, hasPassword: !!password };
//	}
//
// Spread, keep everything, mask one field and fold one nested one. So this must
// not grow a field list either: the routers-public corpus pins that a key
// no struct declares survives, which is the property that would be lost first.
//
// ── THE MASK IS ON THE DECRYPTED VALUE, NOT THE CIPHERTEXT ──────────────────
//
// `_readFile` decrypts before `getPublic` sees the record, so a password this
// install CANNOT read — a rotated `.secret`, a corrupt envelope — discloses `''`
// rather than the mask. The distinction is real: `''` means "no password, or one
// we cannot read", and the mask means "there is one". Both are in the corpus.

// list; it reads as a one-element list, and a record nobody edits is never
// touched on disk."
//
// So a record carrying NEITHER key still discloses `siteIds: []` and
// `siteId: null` — which is what the corpus caught this function missing. The
// page reads `siteIds` to draw membership; an absent key is `undefined`, and
// `undefined.length` is what a renderer hits next.
//
// `siteId` is kept in step as the ROLLBACK MIRROR: position 0 of the list, or
// null. A port emitting only the list would leave an older binary reading no
// membership at all.
