// The supervisor: which collectors to suspend, wake and re-probe on each tick.
//
// ── A PLAN, NOT AN ACTOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Tick` performs nothing. It takes what each collector last produced and
// returns the operations the caller should carry out, in order. Same shape as
// `internal/routers/overview.go`'s `SyncPool` — "one pure SyncPool with no
// RouterOS in it" — and for the same reason: the decisions are the part worth
// pinning, and a decision that can only be observed through a live router is a
// decision nothing tests.
//
// The supervisor holds one `State` per collector across ticks, so it is stateful;
// it is `Tick` that is free of I/O.
//
// ── WHY ONE SUPERVISOR AND NOT A LOOP PER COLLECTOR ─────────────────────────
//
// The live comment: "emptiness is declared once in the registry (`emptyKey`), so
// the judgement reads `lastPayload` generically and no collector grows an
// emptiness hook."
//
// ── DORMANCY IS A VETO, AND THE CALLER MUST HONOUR IT ───────────────────────
//
// Three gates decide whether a collector runs — idle (nobody on this router),
// page rooms (nobody on its page) and dormancy — and they are LAYERED, not
// competing. The live app funnels every resume through `_resumeCollector` so a
// gate that knows nothing about dormancy cannot undo it: "_idleResume calling
// resume() directly is precisely what would wake a dormant collector on the next
// socket join." `IsDormant` is that veto, and the caller has to ask.

type Op struct {
	Key string
	// Do is "suspend", "wake" or "probe".
	//
	// "probe" is deliberately not "resume": the live `_probeCollector` prefers a
	// collector's own `probe()`, which clears a capability latch that `resume()`
	// honours on purpose, and falls back to resume-plus-refreshNow so the answer
	// arrives on this tick rather than one poll interval later. Which of those a
	// given collector gets is the CALLER's knowledge, not this package's.

//
// ── THE PAYLOAD IS READ BY THE CALLER, NOT HERE ─────────────────────────────
//
// The live supervisor reads `lastPayload` generically because a JavaScript
// payload is already a map. This port has two callers with two representations —
// `internal/session` holds typed structs and reads them by json tag, and the
// corpus test holds the maps the live app produced — so the READING is theirs
// and the JUDGEMENT is this package's.
//
// They do not each own the rule: `collection.PayloadEmptyBy` is the rule, and
// both supply it a lookup. `TestTheLookupAgreesWithTheMapLookup` drives one
// payload through both and fails if they ever disagree, which is what carries
// The live corpus across to the struct side.
type Collector struct {
	Key string
	// Enabled is the operator's per-router switch. A collector turned off is
	// skipped entirely — it is not asleep, it is not running.
	Enabled bool
	// Present is whether the collector has produced a payload at all. A
	// collector with no payload yet is neither judged nor probed: it has said
	// nothing, which is not the same as saying nothing is there.
	Present bool
	// TS is the payload's timestamp. A repeated one means the collector has
	// produced nothing new — see Observe.
	TS int64
	// Empty is `payloadEmpty(payload, def.emptyKey)`.
	Empty bool
	// Unsupported is `payload.available === false`: this RouterOS has no such
	// menu, which earns the MAXIMUM backoff rather than the base one.
	Unsupported bool
}

// TickInput is one supervisor tick.
type TickInput struct {
	Now int64
	// Watching is whether anybody is in this router's room.
	//
	// JUDGE ONLY WHILE SOMEBODY IS WATCHING. A suspended collector emits nothing,
	// so an idle session would read as universally empty and put the whole set to
	// sleep for a reason that has nothing to do with the router. The live guard
	// is a room-size check; this is the same question, asked by the caller.

	// dormant set every tick would be a payload per fifteen seconds per router
	// saying what the last one said.

// ── THE MAP IS GUARDED, AND THE REASON IS THIS PORT, NOT THE ORIGINAL ─────
//
// The live supervisor is reached from one event loop, so its map cannot race and
// it has no lock. Here it is reached from at least three goroutines:
//
//	the dormancy ticker    `Tick`      (session/dormancy_run.go)
//	the connect loop       `Reset`     on reconnect (session.go)
//	websocket handlers     `WakeForFocus`, `IsDormant`, `Dormant` on page focus
//
// and `state(key)` WRITES the map on first sight of a collector, so three of
// those are writers. A page focus during a tick is a concurrent map write, which
// is a RUNTIME FATAL: it takes the process, not the request.
//
// That is not hypothetical. `alert.Evaluator` had the identical shape — ported
// from JS, plain maps, no lock — and killed the server on 2026-08-29 with
// `fatal error: concurrent map writes`. This one was found by asking which OTHER
// ported objects hold unguarded state, and confirmed with the race detector.
