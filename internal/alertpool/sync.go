// Package alertpool is the port of `src/alertSessions.js`: a background pool
// that holds a connection to every router NOBODY IS WATCHING, so the app knows
// their Online/Offline state and evaluates their alerts.
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS, AND WHAT ITS ABSENCE COST ───────────────────────────────
//
// The live app runs TWO background pools and this port had ported one:
//
//	overviewSessions   gated on the Devices page (`_routersPageSockets`).
//	                   `internal/routers.Pool` is its port, and the gating is
//	                   faithful.
//	alertSessions      ALWAYS ON. One session per non-disabled, non-active
//	                   router, whatever page anyone is looking at.
//
// Two consequences, both found on 2026-08-29 and the second reported by the
// operator before it was understood:
//
//  1. ALERTS ONLY FIRED FOR THE ROUTER BEING WATCHED. `alertwire.Evaluate` is
//     reached from exactly one place — the emit closure in `session.go` — and
//     sessions exist only for routers a browser has open. With `-alert-dispatch`
//     on, an operator would believe the fleet was covered while every router but
//     the one on screen was silent.
//  2. NON-ACTIVE ROUTERS READ OFFLINE AT STARTUP, and came online a few seconds
//     after the Devices page was opened — because the only pool that connects to
//     them is the Devices-gated one.
//
// ── THE SPLIT THIS PACKAGE KEEPS ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `alertsEnabled` decides whether a session runs COLLECTORS. The live comment
// is explicit that a status-only session needs none: "the ROS connection events
// alone provide Online/Offline state" (`alertSessions.js:97`). So a router with
// alerts off costs one TCP connection and nothing else — which matters on the
// small hardware #105 exists for, and is why this is not simply "run the
// overview pool always".

// The decision — which sessions to build, drop and rebuild — is the part with

// verdict below is checkable against `alertSessions.js:28-47` by reading; none
// of it needs a socket.

	// become the active one, or is now owned by the overview pool.
	Drop []string
	// Rebuild is the ids whose `alertsEnabled` changed. A flag change cannot be
	// applied in place because it decides whether the session HAS collectors, so
	// the session is torn down and built again — which is what the live loop
	// does by dropping it and letting the second loop recreate it.

//
// A session is wanted for every router that is NOT:
//
//	disabled   — "a disabled router is not connected to at all"
//	active     — the interactive session already has it, and a second connection
//	             to the same router is the cost this pool exists to avoid
//	pool-owned — `excluded`, the ids the overview pool holds. The live call site
//	             passes `_poolOwnedIds()` for exactly this.
//
// AN EMPTY activeID IS NOT A WILDCARD. A fresh install has no active router, and
// reading "" as "exclude the router whose id is empty" is correct only because
// no router has an empty id — asserted by a test rather than left to luck.
