// until somebody looks — so on first open, every router but the selected one had
// no source at all and its card claimed "Offline" until the overview pool
// finished dialling, about three seconds later.
//
// ALMOST EVERYTHING HERE IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED, and reading it costs no
// extra router channel — the measure that matters (see CLAUDE.md's "more
// efficient"). The ONE exception is the `primedSystem()` branch below: that
// reading is not a by-product of alerting, it is a command `PrimeStats` spends
// deliberately, once per collector-less session per Devices focus. It is still
// on a socket this pool already holds, which is the property worth having, but
// "costs nothing" is not true of it and a change that leans on that sentence
// will be leaning on the wrong half.
//
// TWO FIELDS, NOT `routers.Summary`'s SIX. `Connected` is available for every
// router the pool holds, including a status-only one; `IfStatus` exists only
// where alerting is enabled, because a status-only session deliberately runs no
// collectors. `System` is the one that can arrive either way — from the
// collector where alerting is on, and from the prime where it is not. There is
// no `DHCPLeases` — this pool has no leases collector — so a card fed from here
// shows its Clients count as "—" until the overview pool arrives, which is the
// honest rendering of "not read yet" and exactly what a null already means on
// this page.
