// TestCollectorsWithoutAnEmptyKeyHaveAMeasuredReason records why each
// disableable collector that cannot be judged for dormancy cannot be.
//
// ── WHERE THESE ANSWERS COME FROM ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The operator's instruction on 2026-09-08 was to derive the missing keys from
// the test CHR — a genuinely empty router — on the reasoning that any payload
// field coming back as an empty array there is a field that CAN be empty, which
// is what `emptyKey` means.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT WAS TAKEN AND IT DISAGREED, for three of the four. The CHR is
// not empty in the dimensions these collectors care about, and more importantly
// the emptiness of a field is not the whole question: what matters is whether an
// all-empty payload means "nothing to report". Three times it does not, and each
// time for a different structural reason. So the derivation produced one key and
// three recorded refusals, which is a better answer than four keys would have
// been.
//
// ── THE LEDGER FAILS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// A disableable collector with no key and no entry here is a failure: that is
// the omission this exists to prevent. An entry for a collector that HAS a key
// is also a failure, because the reason has expired and a stale reason is how
// this repository loses premises.
