//
// ── A BUG THE INSTRUMENT FOUND IN ITSELF, AND A CALL SITE NO UNIT TEST SEES ─
//
// `roslimit` counts the channels this process holds per router, so B.4 can tell
// whether moving a collector to a stream cost anything. Every channel is a tag
// on ONE TCP connection, so a drop takes them all with it whether or not a
// collector called its stop.
//
// Measured on 2026-09-09, minutes after the counter was deployed: three routers
// reported 3 open channels and the fourth reported 4 — and the fourth was the
// only one that had reconnected. Forcing a second reconnect took it to 5. One of
// the three streaming collectors does not release across a redial, so the level
// grew by one per outage and a flapping router would have inflated it
// indefinitely. That is the one thing an instrument about channel pressure must
// not do.
//
// The fix is one call in `connectLoop`'s drop path, and **deleting it fails no
// unit test**: the level is per-router state in another package, and every test
// of it passes whether or not anything in production calls it. That is exactly
// the shape `internal/verify` exists for, so the call site is read here.
//
// ── IT MUST BE THE DROP PATH, NOT ANYWHERE ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Asserting only that the file mentions `StreamsGone` would pass against a call
// in `Shutdown`, or in a comment, and the level would still climb on every
// reconnect. So this locates the block that nils the client and checks the call
// is inside it.

	// the first match found Reconfigure's and reported the call missing when it
	// was present twenty lines below the other one.
	//
	// Reconfigure needs no call of its own: closing the client makes
	// `waitUntilDown` return, so the loop reaches THIS path and clears the level
	// there. One authoritative call site, which is the point.
