// TestCollectorEdgesAreDeclared is step 2.1 of the collector rewrite: the
// in-process edges between collectors, written down and held to.
//
// ── WHAT AN EDGE IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A collector handed a POINTER TO ANOTHER COLLECTOR at construction, rather than
// the data it wanted. `bridges` needs interface rates, so it is given the whole
// of `ifStatus`; `queues` needs one FastTrack summary, so it is given the whole
// of `firewall`.
//
// These are the reason disabling one collector silently degrades pages that look
// unrelated, and the reason the registry's `requires` -- which knows about ONE of
// them -- describes so little of the real graph. They are invisible from either
// end: nothing in `internal/collect` says who holds a pointer to it, and nothing
// in the registry says a page will quietly lose a column.
//
// ── IT FAILS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A new edge that nobody recorded is a failure, and a recorded edge that has
// gone is also a failure. Without the second half this becomes folklore: phases
// 2 and 3 remove these one at a time, and a list that does not shrink with them
// would go on describing a graph that no longer exists.

	// ── the declared graph ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

	// TWELVE, NOT THE NINE Collectors-Rewrite.md claims in its prose. The
	// document's own table lists these same twelve and then calls them nine, and
	// nothing anywhere re-counted them. That is what this test is for.
	//
	// The `what` is not decoration. It is the field that decides whether an edge
	// CAN be removed the way phase 2 proposes -- by having the consumer read the
	// underlying menu through the cache instead. An edge carrying `rates` cannot:
	// rates come from `/interface/monitor-traffic` with a once argument, which is
	// one of the three menus step 1.4 established as uncacheable, so there is no
	// menu underneath for a consumer to read.

		// edges: the router's ARP table is the only place that says which MAC is
		// behind which IP, and every one of these consumers needs that join to
		// put a name or an address on a device.
		//
		// The `what` field decides whether phase 2 could remove an edge by
		// having the consumer read the menu itself. Here it could — `/ip/arp/print`
		// is an ordinary cacheable table — and it still should not: four
		// consumers reading it separately is four subscriptions and four copies
		// of the same index, which is exactly what the coalescing cache and this

		// heaviest table in the app and deposited the snapshot for `bandwidth`
		// to difference, so `bandwidth` never issued the command at all.
		//
		// The entry also carried an instruction -- "THIS ONE MUST NOT BE REMOVED
		// by phase 2. Step 1.4 measured the alternative and found it strictly
		// worse: routing that menu through the cache would share the READ, while
		// this shares the PARSE." THAT WAS WRONG IN ITS PREMISE. `ConnTable`
		// shared raw rows, not a parse, so the alternative shared exactly the
		// same thing by the mechanism every other menu uses. 3.2d subscribed both
		// collectors and 2026-09-09 deleted the table.

		// Recorded here rather than silently dropped, because the instruction it
		// carried was repeated to an operator as fact twice.

// hook), so the set is derived from the file rather than listed -- a new
// collector joins it by being constructed, which is the only way one can exist.

// "everything up to the next assignment", which is wrong for the LAST collector
// constructed: its extent ran to the end of the function and swallowed the
// UseCache wiring block, which names every collector, so it reported an edge from
// nearly everything to `traffic`. Parenthesis depth from the opening bracket is
// the real boundary, and chained setters like `WithSources` are then consumed
// deliberately, because an edge declared in one is as real as an edge in an
// argument list.

// Prose between statements cannot register: a mention has to be spelled
// `s.<name>` to match. A string literal holding an unbalanced bracket would
// confuse the depth count; there is none in this file, and the construction-count
