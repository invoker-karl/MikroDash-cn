// TestWebSocketVocabulary: every event the server sends has a listener, and every
// event a page listens for is sent.
//
// ── THE BUG CLASS, WITH A RECENT EXAMPLE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both directions fail silently. A page subscribing to an event nothing emits
// simply never renders -- no error, no warning, an empty card. On 2026-08-31
// three dashboard cards sat empty for exactly that reason: `dashboard.ts` listened
// for `routing:update` and the collector only ever emitted it to `page-routing`,
// so a viewer who never opened the Routing page saw em dashes forever.
//
// The other direction is quieter still: an event nobody consumes is work the
// server does for nothing, and it looks identical to an event whose consumer was
// deleted by accident.
//
// ── WHY LEDGERS RATHER THAN A CLEAN LIST ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Some gaps are real and deliberate. They are recorded WITH THEIR REASON, and the
// check fails in BOTH directions: an unrecorded gap is a failure, and a recorded
// gap that has closed is ALSO a failure, so an entry cannot outlive the situation
// it describes. That is the property that stops a ledger becoming folklore.

// eventsUnconsumed: emitted by the server, deliberately nobody listens.
