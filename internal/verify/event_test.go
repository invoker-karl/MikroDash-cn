// TestWebSocketVocabulary: every event the server sends has a listener, and every
// event a page listens for is sent.
//
// ── THE BUG CLASS, WITH A RECENT EXAMPLE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both directions fail silently. A page subscribing to an event nothing emits
// simply never renders -- no error, no warning, an empty card. On 2026-08-31
// three dashboard cards sat empty for exactly that reason: `dashboard.ts` listened
// for `routing:update` and the collector only ever emitted it to `page-routing`,
// so a viewer who never opened the Routing page saw em dashes forever.
//
// The other direction is quieter still: an event nobody consumes is work the
// server does for nothing, and it looks identical to an event whose consumer was
// deleted by accident.
//
// ── WHY LEDGERS RATHER THAN A CLEAN LIST ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Some gaps are real and deliberate. They are recorded WITH THEIR REASON, and the
// check fails in BOTH directions: an unrecorded gap is a failure, and a recorded
// gap that has closed is ALSO a failure, so an entry cannot outlive the situation
// it describes. That is the property that stops a ledger becoming folklore.

// eventsUnconsumed: emitted by the server, deliberately nobody listens.
var eventsUnconsumed = map[string]string{
	"packages:applying": "vestigial in the live app too — it was emitted and nothing listened. " +
		"Reproduced rather than dropped, so a future reader finds this note instead of " +
		"'fixing' a consumer into existence.",
}

// eventsUnserved: a page listens, deliberately nothing emits it.
// `stream:health` LEFT THIS LIST ON 2026-09-04, and the entry was right when it
// was written: nothing reported stream health, so the Dashboard's warning
// element stayed empty, which is honest. What the note could not say is that the
// MECHANISM behind it was missing too — the traffic stream had no watchdog, so a
// stream that silently stalled was never restarted and never reported. The
// entry described the quiet half of a real fault. Both halves are ported now.
//
// `diagnostics:update` LEFT ON 2026-09-10, and its note had the same defect. It
// said "there is no diagnostics collector... the card renders empty", which reads
// as a deliberate omission — and the card DID render empty, so nothing ever
// contradicted it. What it could not say is that there is no diagnostics
// collector BY DESIGN: the numbers are in this process, so a collector would be
// the wrong mechanism, and what was actually missing was a sender.
// `internal/server/diagnostics.go` is that sender.
//
// `alert:fired` and `alert:resolved` LEFT ON 2026-09-11, the other way: their
// listeners were removed rather than a sender added. Nothing had ever sent
// either, and once every handler was typed by the event Go declares
// (web/src/socket.ts), a listener for an undeclared event stopped compiling.
// The list is empty, and stays a check: a page listening for something nobody
// sends now fails here AND in tsc.
var eventsUnserved = map[string]string{}

// eventTypeSources are the browser's payload TYPES, and they name every event
// by construction: the generated map is keyed by each declaration, and the hand
