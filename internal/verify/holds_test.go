// TestEveryHoldReasonIsTaken — the third instance of one defect class today, and
// the first one with a gate.
//
// ── DECLARED AND NEVER FILLED ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A hold is a reason a session stays alive and runs a named set of collectors.
// It is declared in three places and TAKEN in a fourth:
//
//	session.Reasons          a field per reason
//	session.reasonsLocked    reads `s.holds["<reason>"]` into that field
//	session.Needs            consults the reason's feed list
//	internal/server          `Retain(id, "<reason>")` — the only thing that sets it
//
// The first three are inert without the fourth, and NOTHING FAILS when it is
// missing: `Reasons.Devices` was read, `devicesFeeds` was consulted, and no code
// path ever took the hold. It cost nothing while `ifStatus` ran from connect on
// every session, and started costing the moment 4.2b gated it on demand — the
// Devices page's WAN RX/TX column was empty for every router, which is how it was
// eventually found.
//
// That is the same shape as `topology.ARPIP` (declared, used at two sites, never
// set) and `pollArp` (persisted, validated, read by nothing), both found the same
// day. This is the one that gets a gate, because a hold is the most expensive
// version: it decides what a router is asked for.

// ── TWICE ON ONE STRUCT, AND THE SECOND TIME HID BEHIND A FALLBACK ────────
//
// `routers.StatsRouter` is the record half of the Devices page's input, built in
// one literal in `internal/server/devices.go`. A field left out of that literal
// is the zero value, and every consumer downstream treats the zero value as an
// answer:
//
//	Geo        never set -> every device arrived with a nil location and the map
//	           dropped ALL of them into the "No location" tray
//	DefaultIf  never set -> the WAN interface resolved to the global default, so
//	           the RX/TX column was empty for any router whose WAN is not called
//	           what the global says
//
// The second one hid for longer because the fallback usually matches: a fleet
// where every router uses the default interface name looks perfectly correct.
// Only the router with a real WAN name showed the gap.
//
// So the literal must mention every field. That is a weaker property than "the
// value is right" and a much stronger position than a comment, because it refuses
// the shape rather than catching an instance.
