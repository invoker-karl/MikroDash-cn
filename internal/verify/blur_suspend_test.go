// TestNoPageSuspendsACollectorByName is the re-aimed blur-suspend audit.
//
// ── WHAT IT USED TO ASSERT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `pageBlur` held a 19-case switch that stopped a page's collectors when the
// operator navigated away. That is correct only while the page is the
// collector's ONLY audience, and several collectors also feed a dashboard card —
// so blurring the page starved the card. This test matched
// `cn.rsession.X().Suspend()` inside that switch and objected when the collector
// behind X emitted to more than one room, insisting on the guarded form.
//
// It caught the same defect five times: dhcpNetworks, bandwidth, vpn, firewall,
// and routing on 2026-09-01 when it gained `page-dashboard` as a second room.
//
// ── WHY IT ASSERTS SOMETHING STRONGER NOW ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Phase 4.2b deleted the switchboard. `applyDemand` asks
// `collect.DemandRooms(key)` for every collector at once, so a page can no
// longer suspend a collector it does not own — the shape that made the defect
// possible is gone rather than guarded.
//
// The old assertion would now pass by inspecting an empty switch, which is worse
// than useless: a green check that cannot fail. So it is re-aimed at the one way
// the defect can come back, which is somebody adding a by-name suspend to a
// page handler again. That is a REFUSAL of a shape rather than a check of a
// list, which is the same move `TestNoBlurGuardNamesARoomItself` made in 4.2 and
// for the same reason: the old check could only catch a disagreement after
// somebody wrote one.

//
// ── WHAT IT ASSERTED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A guarded suspend named its collector by KEY and suspended it by ACCESSOR, and
// nothing connected the two: `collect.Others("vpn", …)` beside
// `Wireless().Suspend` compiled, read perfectly, and consulted the wrong
// collector's rooms. Before that it asserted the room LIST was complete, after
// `suspendConnsIfIdle` passed the two page rooms and not
// `dash-card-connections` — so returning to the dashboard from either page
// suspended the collector with a viewer still watching the card.
//
// ── WHERE THE PROPERTY WENT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both halves are structural now. There is no key-and-accessor pair to mismatch,
// because `applyDemand` iterates `session.TargetKeys()` and passes each key to
// both sides of the question. There is no room list to be incomplete, because
// `collect.DemandRooms` derives it.
//
// What is DRIVEN rather than derived is in `internal/server/demand_behaviour_test.go`:
// `TestEveryDeclaredRoomAloneIsEnough` puts one viewer in each declared room in
// turn and asserts the collector is wanted, which is the same question this test
// asked — can a room be dropped without anybody noticing — asked of the rule
// that replaced the guards.
