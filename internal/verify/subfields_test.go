// TestSubscriptionsDeclareTheirFields refuses a `scheduled` literal that does
// not say which fields it wants.
//
// ── THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `roscache.Subscribe` reads an empty field list as "every field", and
// all-fields STICKS: once one subscriber asks for it, the menu's proplist is
// dropped for the rest of the session and no narrower caller can shrink it back.
// So a subscription that omits `fields` does not merely fail to narrow a read —
// it WIDENS it, permanently, for every collector sharing that menu.
//
// Eighteen collectors were migrated onto the scheduler in 3.2 and every one of
// them omitted it. `/ip/firewall/connection` — the heaviest read in the app, and
// the one phase 1 spent its effort on — was being asked for with a seven-field
// proplist and served with all of them, on a router with thousands of rows.
//
// NOTHING FAILED. The payloads were right, every test was green, and the only
// way to see it was to print `Demand()`. That is the shape this repository keeps
// losing coverage to, so the answer is a check rather than a note.
//
// ── WHY IT DEMANDS THE WORD RATHER THAN A VALUE ─────────────────────────────
//
// A menu with no proplist of its own — `/tool/netwatch`, `/ip/neighbor`,
// `/ip/dns` — genuinely wants every field, and `fields: nil` is the right
// answer there. Since the correct value is sometimes nil, this cannot check the
// value; it checks that the author WROTE THE FIELD DOWN, which is the decision
// that was actually skipped. `fieldsOf(cmd)` makes the common case one call.
