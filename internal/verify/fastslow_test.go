// TestFastPollCollectorsSplitTheirSlowReads is the ledger for the operator's
// fast/slow rule.
//
// ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Set on 2026-09-08: a collector's LIVE reads keep its poll interval, and its
// reads of things that rarely change go to "a 30 second cadence or longer". The
// reason is the one CLAUDE.md states — the bottleneck is concurrent API channels
// on the MikroTik, so cost is commands x frequency, and a menu read 51 times a
// minute that changed once is 50 wasted commands.
//
// It is not a new idea here. Seven collectors already hand-rolled it as a
// `ticks % <x>ConfigEvery` counter, and `system` as a `time.Since` window. What
// the rule did was find the two that had not: `ifStatus`, which was reading four
// menus at a ~1.2s poll and cost 76% of an idle router's entire load, and
// `routing`, which read two whole route tables every ten seconds.
//
// ── WHY A LEDGER AND NOT A COMMENT ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Because the rule is invisible in the thing it governs. A new collector that
// polls five menus at two seconds compiles, passes every test, renders correctly
// and is only ever found by measuring a router. Nothing else in this tree fails.
//
// IT FAILS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, which is the discipline CLAUDE.md sets for every
// ledger here. A fast-polling collector missing from the table fails. A recorded
// exemption whose named constant no longer exists ALSO fails — so an exemption
// cannot outlive the situation it describes, and a `ConfigEvery` deleted in a
// refactor cannot leave a green comment behind claiming it is still there.
