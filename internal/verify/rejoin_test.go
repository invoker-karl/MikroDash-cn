// TestSelectRouterRejoinsEveryPerSocketSubscription.
//
// ── THE UNIT TESTS PASS WITHOUT THE CALL ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `selectRouter` LEAVES EVERY ROOM this socket is in and then joins the ones it
// knows about. Anything a browser subscribed to before the select — a dashboard
// card, a page — is re-established by an explicit replay: `rejoinCards` and
// `rejoinPage`. Each of those has its own tests, and every one of them passes
// with the call to it deleted, because they call the replay directly.
//
// That is the exact shape of the unwired Settings Save button: a correct
// function, its own green tests, and nothing invoking it. Here the cost is a
// browser subscribed to nothing — the payloads go to rooms it is not in, every
// card goes stale, and the server log shows a healthy session throughout. It
// was reported twice before this check existed.
//
// ── A SOURCE PIN, BECAUSE NO REQUEST EXERCISES IT ──────────────────────────
//
// Driving `selectRouter` needs a session manager, a store, a pool and a live
// router. The property is one line of wiring, so it is read rather than run —
// the same trade `TestEveryCardRoomIsEmittedTo` makes next door.

	// closed tab. The rooms must be given up BEFORE demand is re-asked there, so
	// the loop had to live with the release rather than beside three of its four
	// callers.
	//
	// The premise is unchanged and the check follows it: `selectRouter` must
	// still call the thing that leaves every room, and that thing must still
	// leave them. Re-decided rather than relaxed — this Fatal is what forced the
	// question, which is the check working.
