// TestAlertFeedsMatchesWhatTheRulesConsume.
//
// ── THE DEPENDENCY THAT WAS NEVER WRITTEN DOWN ──────────────────────────────
//
// Six alert rules read six collectors' payloads. Nothing connected the two: the
// rules dispatch on event names in `alertwire`, and the collectors are started
// by a list in `session.go` that was written for viewers. Four of the six
// overlapped by luck; `vpn` and `routing` did not, and were running only because
// `primeAll` gave them a payload and the dormancy probe then resumed them.
//
// That is two unrelated mechanisms holding up a third. Turn either off, or move
// when a probe fires, and VPN and BGP alerts stop firing for the router somebody
// is actually watching — with nothing anywhere to say so.
//
// So the dependency is declared as `session.AlertFeeds` and checked here against
// the events `alertwire` really dispatches on. BOTH DIRECTIONS: a rule reading a
// collector that is not fed fails, and a collector listed as fed that no rule
// reads fails too, because that one costs a poll on every alerting router for
// nothing.
