// TestSetBIsDeclared is the ledger for the two ways this app gets data out of a
// router: table reads on one side, measurements and streams on the other.
//
// ── WHY THE SECOND SET NEEDS A LEDGER AND THE FIRST DOES NOT ────────────────
//
// A table read is the default and the safe case. It caches, it dedupes, it
// tolerates being a second old, and everything phase 1 built is about it. About
// sixty of the sixty-four commands in `internal/collect` are one, and a
// sixty-first arriving needs no announcement.
//
// The other set is five call sites across two menus, and between them they carry
// the most expensive acquisition in the app. They obey none of phase 1's rules:
// no cache can serve them, no union of field lists applies, and the cadence work
// that took ifStatus from 204 commands a minute to 58 does not reach the one
// read still costing 52. They are going to need their own model, and the first
// requirement of designing one is knowing exactly what is in the set.
//
// ── IT FAILS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A new measurement or stream that nobody recorded is a failure: it has joined
// the expensive set silently, which is how the ifStatus rates read went unnoticed
// as 76% of an idle router's load. A recorded one that has gone is also a
// failure, because the second track is meant to shrink this list and a list that
// does not shrink stops describing anything.
