// ── NO COLLECTOR ASKS A ROUTER FOR A CREDENTIAL ────────────────────────────
//
// The rule this holds up used to live only in prose. `internal/collect/ppp.go`
// said "/ppp/secret IS NEVER READ … a test enforces it across both", and that
// test was the NODE original's: it went at cutover with the rest of the parity
// harness, so the rule spent the entire port with nothing behind it. Nobody
// noticed, because nothing failed — which is the shape of every expired premise
// this repository has been bitten by.
//
// Issue #125 needed `/ppp/secret` read for subscriber management, so the rule
// was narrowed rather than dropped: the menu IS read, the password is NOT. That
// only means anything if something checks, and this is the something.
//
// A payload cannot leak a value the collector never asked the router for, so the
// proplist is the enforcement point and this reads the proplists.

// reads as one string.
//
// `"…a," +\n\t"b…"` is two literals to the compiler and one proplist to the
// router. Without this the scan would see the halves separately and a credential
// sitting just after a line break would be invisible — a checker that reads less
// than the code does is worse than none, because it reports success.

// TestCredentialReadLedgerIsNotEmpty records WHAT THE TWO ABOVE DO NOT COVER.
//
// A ledger, in the sense the rest of this package uses the word: a gap written
// down is a gap somebody can close, and a gap left to be discovered is how the
// last one survived a whole port.
//
//  1. COMMANDS WITH NO PROPLIST ARE NOT CHECKED. Most reads in
//     `internal/collect` fetch a whole menu, which is correct — a menu holding
//     nothing sensitive is cheaper to read whole than to enumerate. But it means
//     the first test can only speak for the menus that DO carry a proplist.
//     `/ppp/secret` is covered by name in the second test precisely because it
//     is the one menu where that gap would cost something.
//
//  2. PAYLOAD STRUCT FIELDS ARE NOT CHECKED, and the reason is that
//     `audit.IsCredentialField` is too broad to be a gate on them. It is
//     deliberately broad for MASKING, where a false positive costs one field
//     name in an audit row. As a gate it fails on three innocent fields already
//     in the tree — `fasttrackBypassable`, `passwordPolicy` and this feature's
//     own `secrets` — so a struct-tag version would have to either weaken the
//     pattern or carry an exception list, and both are worse than saying plainly
//     that the proplist is where this is enforced.
//
//  3. THE WRITE PATH READS WHAT IT LIKES. `internal/server`'s `readMenu` prints
//     a whole menu with no proplist before every save, delete and action —
//     deliberately, because `ReadOnlyWhen` needs properties no page asks for.
//     So passwords DO enter server memory on a write. They stop there
//     (`RowValues` drops secret-typed fields, the audit masks them), but "no
//     password is ever read" would be false and this file does not claim it.
//     Narrowing that read is a change to shared machinery and is not this
//     feature's to make.
