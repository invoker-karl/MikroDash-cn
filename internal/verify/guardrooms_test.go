// TestNoServerHandlerNamesARoomItself is the other half of 4.2's completeness
// rule, carried forward through the switchboard's deletion.
//
// ── WHAT IT REPLACED, TWICE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Until 4.2 it compared two lists: the rooms `pageBlur` waited on, spelled out by
// hand at each call site, against the rooms the collector emitted to. They had
// disagreed FIVE times — dhcpNetworks, bandwidth, vpn, firewall, and routing on
// 2026-08-31 — each time as a dashboard card that silently stopped updating for
// anybody who had visited the owning page and left.
//
// 4.2 made the wait list derived, so the two could not disagree, and this test
// became a refusal: no call site may go back to writing its own list. 4.2b
// deleted the call sites entirely — there is one question now,
// `collect.DemandRooms(key)`, asked in one place. The refusal is unchanged and
// simply covers more ground: no handler in `internal/server` may name a room a
// collector feeds.
//
// A weaker-sounding property and a stronger position, for the reason 4.2 gave:
// the old check could only catch a disagreement after somebody wrote one, and
// this one refuses the shape that makes disagreement possible.
