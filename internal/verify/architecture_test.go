//
// ── WHY A DOCUMENT NEEDS A GATE AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// CLAUDE.md names this repository's most expensive recurring defect: "a blocker
// that has been closed reads exactly like one that never was, and nothing fails
// when a premise expires". Every working document in this tree has gone stale at
// least once, and each time it was believed for a while first — a session read a
// closed exemption in `sharedmenu_test.go`, believed it, and argued a
// double-parse objection that had been measured wrong months earlier.
//
// So the architecture document states its numbers and its collector list in a
// machine-readable shape, and this re-computes them. It fails in BOTH
// directions, which is the rule every ledger here follows: a claim that has gone
// stale is a failure, and so is a collector that exists and is undescribed.
