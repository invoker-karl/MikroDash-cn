// Every field on server.Options must be set by the binary that builds one.
//
// ── THE BUG THAT MADE THIS NECESSARY ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Options.OriginPatterns` existed from the v0.8.0 cutover and NOTHING EVER SET
// IT. No flag, no env var, no literal. Empty means "same-origin only" to
// `coder/websocket`, so every install behind a reverse proxy — where the
// browser's Origin and this process's Host differ by definition — was refused at
// the handshake with "request Origin ... is not authorized for Host ...".
//
// It shipped in every published Go image, 0.8.1 through 0.8.20, and arrived as
// issue #128 from an operator who could not open the UI through their proxy.
//
// Nothing could have caught it. The field compiled, the struct was complete, the
// tests passed, and the doc comment beside the field actively said empty was
// what a proxied deployment wanted — which is backwards, and is presumably why
// no flag was ever written.
//
// ── WHY THE WHOLE STRUCT AND NOT JUST THAT FIELD ────────────────────────────
//
// A gate naming `OriginPatterns` would pin the bug already fixed and nothing
// else. The CLASS is "a server option that exists and no caller sets", and it is
// invisible by construction: an unset option is the zero value, which is always
// a legal value and usually a quiet one. Checking every field costs the same and
// covers the next one.
//
// An option that is deliberately left to its zero value belongs in
// `optionsExpectedUnset` WITH A REASON, and an entry that starts being set is a
// failure too — otherwise the list becomes an excuse rather than a record.
