// Package verify holds the repository's static self-checks.
//
// ── WHAT THIS PACKAGE IS, AND WHY IT IS ONLY TESTS ──────────────────────────
//
// These were 171 JavaScript gates under `tools/`, run by `tools/verify.sh`. The
// large majority of them asserted one thing: that the port still reproduced a
// frozen recording of the Node implementation it replaced. That question stopped
// being worth asking when the port ended -- this is the product now, not a
// reproduction of one, and a gate that fails whenever the rendering changes taxes
// every deliberate change.
//
// The ones that moved here asked a DIFFERENT question. They read the CURRENT
// source and assert a property that is still true and still worth holding, with
// no reference to what Node did. Three of them caught real defects in the weeks
// before this migration, which is why they were relocated rather than deleted.
//
// There is deliberately no non-test file in this package. A check is not code the
// binary should be able to link, and keeping it `_test.go`-only makes that
// structural rather than a convention someone has to remember.
//
// ── SCANNING TYPESCRIPT AS TEXT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Several of these read `web/src/**/*.ts` with regexes rather than a parser. That
// is not a shortcut taken in the move: the JavaScript originals did exactly the
// same thing, in a language that HAS the TypeScript compiler available. Where a
// check genuinely needed real semantic resolution -- `orphan-check`, which
// distinguishes a read from a read through a shadowing local -- it stayed in
// JavaScript under `web/test/` rather than being ported to a weaker heuristic
// here. Knowing which of those two a check needs is the whole reason the split
// runs along mechanism instead of filename.

// ── WHY A WALK AND NOT `git ls-files` ───────────────────────────────────────

// The JavaScript original asked git for the tracked set, which was right for it:
// it ran on the host, where git exists. These tests run inside
// `golang:1.25-alpine`, which has NO git, while CI runs them on a runner that
// does. Asking git would mean the same check reading a different set of files in
// the two places -- and a check that disagrees with CI about what it looked at is
// worse than no check.
//
// Walking is also the safe direction for the one check where the difference
// matters. `TestNoCommittedCredential` scans a SUPERSET of the tracked files
// this way: an untracked local file with a real token in it is still worth
// hearing about, even though it is not yet the exposure vector.
