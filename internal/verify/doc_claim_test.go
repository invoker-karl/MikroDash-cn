// TestDocumentedClaimsAreTrue re-measures the numbers `CLAUDE.md` asserts.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This repository's most expensive recurring defect is a premise that expired: a
// closed blocker still listed as open, a count that drifted, a comment describing
// a constraint that no longer applies. Three such claims were wrong on the day the
// JavaScript version of this check was first written, and this migration found
// four more — including a file header stating the opposite of what its own code
// did.
//
// Prose cannot be compiled. This is the closest available substitute: every
// number the document states about ITSELF or about this tree is measured, and a
// drift fails.
//
// ── AND WHY IT IS WRITTEN LAST ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It pins whatever the document currently says. Writing it before the document
// settled would have pinned the numbers that were about to change.
type docClaim struct {
	label string
	// doc is the file the claim lives in, relative to the repository root.
	// Empty means CLAUDE.md, which is where most of them are.
	//
	// A CLAIM IS NOT ONE PER NUMBER, IT IS ONE PER SENTENCE THAT STATES IT. The
	// same count is written in more than one place, and only the places listed
	// here are measured: CLAUDE.md's table row was pinned while the prose
	// twenty lines below it was not, so the prose could keep a number the audit
	// had already corrected in the table — with the audit green. CONTRIBUTING.md
	// was never read at all and had drifted by eleven and seven.
