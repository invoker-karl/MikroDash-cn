// TestPageOwnershipIsReal checks `pages.Page.Collector` against two independent
// facts: the collector registry, and the rooms the collectors actually emit to.
//
// ── WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN internal/pages ───────────────────────────
//
// `internal/pages` imports NOTHING, and three commands depend on that — it is
// read by `cmd/webbuild`, `cmd/pagesgen` and `internal/server`, and giving it a
// dependency on `internal/collection` would drag the registry into the frontend
// build. So the cross-check goes where cross-checks go.
//
// ── THE THIRD ASSERTION IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THIS WORTH HAVING ─────────────
//
// Checking that an owner names a real registry key proves only that somebody
// typed a valid string. Checking that the named collector EMITS TO `page-<key>`
// proves the declaration describes the running app — and that is the property
// phase 4.2 wants to build on, because the whole point of a view declaring its
// rooms is that nothing else gets to have a second opinion about them.

	// emit literal, which meant a regex, a collector-key-to-filename table, and an
	// exemption for `logs` and `talkers` because they emitted to a named constant
	// and could not be seen at all.
	//
	// Now that every audience is declared, the check asks the declaration
	// directly. No regex to drift, no filenames to keep, and no exemptions —
	// `logs` is checked like everything else.
	//
	// THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS ASSERTION WAS THEATRE, and it is worth
	// remembering why: it searched EVERY collector file, so re-declaring
	// `interfaces` as owned by `netwatch` passed — `ifstatus.go` still emitted to
	// `page-interfaces` and the scan did not care who did. Reading one
	// collector's own declaration is what makes it mean something.
