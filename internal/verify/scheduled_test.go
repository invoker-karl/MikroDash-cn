// TestScheduledCollectorsAreDeclared records which collectors have moved off
// their own timers onto the router's scheduler, and — more usefully — which have
// not and why.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A PARAGRAPH ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Phase 3.3 proposes replacing the dormancy supervisor with per-query backoff,
// and it was BLOCKED on a number: only 8 of the 18 dormancy-eligible collectors
// were scheduled, so backoff would have covered eight while the supervisor kept
// ticking for ten -- two mechanisms with different semantics, side by side.
//
// That number was the whole argument, and a number in a document is exactly what
// this repository has watched go stale. So it re-measured itself here, and on
// 2026-09-08 it reached 18 of 18 and said so.
//
// IT WAS TURNED ROUND RATHER THAN DELETED. The property is still worth holding:
// a collector that falls off the scheduler stops being covered by backoff, and
// nothing else would notice.
//
// It fails in both directions: a collector that starts subscribing without being
// listed fails, and a listed one that stops fails too.
//
// `Unscheduled_Collectors.md` is the readable companion to the `unscheduled` map
// below -- same twelve entries, same grades, plus what would have to change for
// each. It is gitignored, like the other working documents, so THIS is the copy
// that survives a clone: keep the reasons here even when the prose moves.

	// ── EVERY UNSCHEDULED COLLECTOR, AND HOW STRONG THE REASON ACTUALLY IS ──

	// Kept complete rather than limited to the dormancy-eligible ones, and graded

	// four obstacles recorded under 3.2 turn out to be the second kind when
	// written down honestly. The grade is the thing to challenge.
	//
	//	IMPOSSIBLE   there is no cadence to schedule. A stream has no result and
	//	             no end; scheduling it is not a thing that means anything.
	//	NEEDS 4.2    driven by another collector's OUTPUT. Wants a subscription to
	//	             a derivation, which does not exist yet.
	//	PARTIAL      part of it is schedulable today and has not been done. These
	//	             are the weakest claims on this list.
	//	NOT TRIED    no obstacle found. Just not done.

		//	bandwidth  "takes the PARSED snapshot from connTable, so scheduling it
		//	           on the connection menu would duplicate the heaviest read in
		//	           the app". `ConnTable.Latest` returns RAW rows, and the
		//	           demand set coalesces by menu -- so two collectors wanting
		//	           the same menu is one read with two deliveries.
		//	vlans      "subscribing it to a menu would slow its rate column from 5s
		//	           to 60s". True of a plain subscription; mechanism A is the

		//	           rates, and its residual half reads nothing at all.
		//

		// a grade written from the collector's CURRENT wiring reads like a
		// property of the problem.

		// read "possible and was not tried" underneath the grade, and all three
