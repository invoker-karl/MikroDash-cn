// Both were filed as `attrMarkup`: "in extracted markup for a feature this port
// has not taken on". That reason was FALSE when it was written. They are the
// Gbps/Mbps toggle in the Add/Edit Router dialog — a shipped page, rendered on
// every open — and nothing read them because the toggle had simply never been
// wired. Clicking it did nothing, which a user reported on issue #124.
//
// So the ledger was not recording a gap; it was excusing a bug, in the exact
// words that stop anyone looking again. The entry is what a reader would have
// trusted. Worth keeping the note: this check fails in both directions
// precisely so an entry cannot outlive its reason, and here the reason was
// never true rather than having expired.
