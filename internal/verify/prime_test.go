// TestDevicesFocusPrimesTheAlertPool.
//
// ── THE POOL CAN ONLY BE PRIMED BY SOMEBODY ASKING ─────────────────────────
//
// `session.Manager.PrimeStats` is deliberately not a poll: a router with alerting and
// reporting both off holds a bare socket and runs no collectors, and reading its
// gauges on a schedule would give back the cost the toggle exists to remove. It
// is taken ONCE, when a browser opens the Devices page, on a connection that is
// already open.
//
// So the whole feature is one call in one handler, and its own unit tests pass
// with that call deleted — they drive `PrimeStats` directly. What comes back is
// the symptom it was added for: a card with a green badge over an empty CPU,
// memory and uptime for the two seconds the overview pool takes to dial. Nothing
// errors, nothing logs, and the page eventually fills in, which is what makes it
// easy to lose and hard to notice.
//
// Read rather than run, like the rejoin check next door — but ONLY as the cheap
// half. `internal/server`'s TestTheFirstFrameAfterAFocusCarriesThePrimedGauges
// drives `devicesFocus` and asserts the frame, which is the property that
// matters and the one a comment cannot satisfy. This one catches the call being
// deleted without a test binary having to dial anything.
//
// THE CODE, NOT THE COMMENTARY. The body is stripped of comments before it is
// searched: this file's own subject is a function whose comments discuss
// `PrimeStats()` at length, so a scan of the raw text would be satisfied by the
// prose explaining the call even after the call itself had gone. That is the
// "a check must not read itself" trap in CLAUDE.md, reached from one step away.

	// overview pool is answering. That reads as a working call and fixes nothing.
