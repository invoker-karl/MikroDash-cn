// TestCitedPathsExist: every source path cited in a comment or a document is a
// file that is actually there.
//
// ── WHY IT EARNS ITS KEEP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This repository explains itself in prose, heavily, and a comment naming a file
// is the most common form that takes. A path that stops being true is worse than
// no comment: it sends the next reader looking for something that moved, and
// nothing else in the build has any opinion about the inside of a comment.
//
// It has fired three times on comments that failed their own check, and the
// deletion of the port record on 2026-08-31 broke roughly seventy citations at
// once -- which is exactly the failure mode this catches.
//
// ── WIDER THAN THE ORIGINAL, DELIBERATELY ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The JavaScript version scanned `tools/*.js` and `CLAUDE.md`. That was the wrong
// scope: the citations that broke on 2026-08-31 were in shipped Go and
// TypeScript comments, which it never read. This reads the documents AND the
// source.
// The optional `(?:[a-z]+ )*` prefix matters more than it looks. Citations are
// often written as a COMMAND -- `node tools/x.js`, `sh tools/verify.sh` -- and a
// pattern anchored to the backtick misses every one of them. That gap hid five
// dangling references to deleted generators until it was widened, which is
// exactly the failure this check exists to prevent, committed by the check.
var citePattern = regexp.MustCompile(
	"`(?:[a-z]+ )*((?:web/src|internal|tools|cmd|testdata|docs)/[A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\\.(?:ts|go|js|mjs|json|md|sh|css|html))`")

// isIllustrative: a path written as a shape rather than a location, e.g.
// `internal/.../thing.go`. Nothing is claimed to exist, so nothing is checked.

// expectedAbsent are paths cited that are EXPECTED not to exist — a note about
// something deleted, or a file a later change will add. Each needs a reason, and
// an entry that starts existing is itself a failure, so the list cannot rot.

		// -- a note SAYING "x.js was deleted" reads as a citation OF x.js. That
