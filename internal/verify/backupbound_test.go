// EVERY ROUTEROS COMMAND ON THE BACKUP AND RESTORE PATH IS BOUNDED.
//
// ── WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `internal/routeros` says of a zero Cmd.Timeout: "no bound, which is correct
// for a stream and wrong for everything else." Nothing enforced the second half,
// and on 2026-09-07 it cost a day's backups on this install.
//
// The chain, all four links verified in source at the time:
//
//  1. these commands carried no Timeout, so they waited for ever;
//  2. `Session.InWriteQueue` is a bare mutex — it takes the lock and calls the
//     function with no deadline;
//  3. `backups.Scheduler.Tick` calls that queue SYNCHRONOUSLY, in the ticker's
//     own goroutine;
//  4. `claim` then refuses every later tick, and said nothing about it.
//
// So one unanswered read stopped the scheduler for the whole fleet, until the
// process was restarted, with no error, no row and no log line. A daily 08:00
// backup ran at 10:52 that day, on the first tick after a restart.
//
// ── WHY THE RESTORE FILE IS IN SCOPE ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The restore runs inside the SAME per-session `InWriteQueue` a scheduled backup
// takes, so an unbounded command there holds the queue a later backup needs and
// reaches the identical stall. It was the more certain of the two routes:
// `/system/backup/load` is documented in that file as never answering, because
// it reboots the router and its reply is already discarded. Unbounded, it was a
// guaranteed permanent hold rather than a possible one.
//
// ── WHY A STATIC CHECK AND NOT A UNIT TEST ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The bound is set where the command is constructed, in a closure over a live
// session, and the regression is someone adding a SIXTH call site without one —
// which is exactly how the five in the restore file came to exist. That is a
// property of the source, so the source is what is read. `internal/alertpool`
// had this same defect fixed before, and nothing generalised the rule; this is
// the generalisation, for the paths that have now paid for it twice.
var execCmdRe = regexp.MustCompile(`Exec\(routeros\.Cmd\{`)

// backupBoundFiles are the paths this rule covers.
//
// NAMED RATHER THAN GLOBBED, and the narrowness is deliberate. Plenty of
// interactive reads elsewhere are unbounded and that is a separate question with
// a separate answer — widening this to every Exec in the tree would make it fail
// on day one and be switched off, which is how a check becomes folklore. It
// covers the paths where a hang is known to wedge a shared mutex.
