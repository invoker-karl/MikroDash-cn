// Package historywire feeds collector samples into `internal/history`'s
// bucketer and persists the minute rows it rolls over.
//
// ── IT IS CUTOVER CODE AND IT IS OFF UNLESS SWITCHED ON ────────────────────
//
// Two processes bucketing the same samples into one SQLite file DOUBLE every
// row, and during coexistence Node is the one doing it. So `New` takes
// `enabled bool`, the server passes false, and a disabled wire records nothing —
// not even into its own in-memory buckets, so turning it on later starts from a
// clean minute rather than flushing a backlog of samples nobody wrote.
//
// the port record's checklist lists this as step 0: code that must exist and be
// tested BEFORE the window rather than discovered inside it.
//
// ── BOTH SAMPLES COME FROM THE EMIT SEAM, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE ───────────
//
// The live app records ping from a hook rather than from the room-scoped emit,
// and its comment says why: `recordPing` "used to sit on the router-wide emit()
// alone, so the moment ping:update became page-scoped (issue #108) history would
// have stopped being written, silently, with the Ping report going empty and
// nothing logging an error."
//
// This port's seam is the emit CLOSURE, which every collector payload passes
// through before any room is chosen — so it sees a page-scoped event exactly as
// it sees a router-wide one. The hazard that forced the live app onto a hook
// does not exist here, and that is the reason to use the seam rather than an
// accident of it.
//
// TRAFFIC is a per-second stream: `/interface/monitor-traffic` is fixed at one
// sample per second per interface, and `history.Writer`'s megabyte accumulation
// assumes exactly that. It is not a poll interval that can be tuned.
