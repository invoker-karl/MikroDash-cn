// The connectivity half of the history wire.
//
// ── IT IS NOT DRIVEN BY THE EMIT SEAM, UNLIKE TRAFFIC AND PING ─────────────
//
// A connectivity row records a SESSION LIFECYCLE event — the router's API
// connection opening or closing — and there is no collector payload for that.
// So this half has three explicit entry points instead, matching the live
// handlers: `Connected`, `Disconnected` (which is one handler for both `close`
// and `connectionError` there and must stay one here) and `Tick`.
//
// ── THE DEBOUNCE IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT LIVES IN internal/history ──────
//
// `history.Connectivity` holds the four rules — a transition writes, the
// observed moment is captured when the link drops rather than when the timer
// fires, a first sighting writes immediately, and a threshold of ZERO really
// means zero. It is pinned there. This file owns only the per-router map, the
// threshold, and the persistence.
//
// THE THRESHOLD DEFAULTS TO 30 SECONDS and is clamped to 0-300, matching
// `src/routers.js:571` and `index.js:647`. Zero is a legitimate setting meaning
// "declare it down immediately", NOT an unset value to be replaced by the
// default — a port that treated it as unset would silently debounce a router
// whose operator asked for no debounce at all.

// ConnDefaultSec is the live default when a record carries no threshold.
const ConnDefaultSec = 30

// ConnMaxSec is the live upper clamp.
const ConnMaxSec = 300

// ThresholdMs turns a record's `connDownThresholdSec` into milliseconds.
//
// `sec` is the value as read, and `ok` reports whether the record carried one at
// all — the two are different questions, and conflating them is how a deliberate
// zero becomes a thirty-second debounce.
func ThresholdMs(sec int, ok bool) int64 {

		// Out of range is the DEFAULT, not a clamp to the bound: the live
		// expression is `(n >= 0 && n <= 300) ? n : 30`, so 500 becomes 30
		// rather than 300.
