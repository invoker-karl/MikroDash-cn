// The Routers page's background pool — the port of `src/overviewSessions.js`,
// as pure decisions with no RouterOS in them.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The Routers page shows a row per router, including routers nobody has open.
// Those numbers come from somewhere: a pool holding a connection per unwatched
// router, running THREE collectors — system, interfaceStatus, dhcpLeases — and
// caching their payloads for `BuildRow`.
//
// ── IT IS NOT `Session`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ────────────────────────
//
// `internal/session.Session` starts FOURTEEN collectors on connect (pinned by
// `TestTheBackgroundCollectorCountIsRecorded`). The live pool runs three. Using
// `Session` for routers nobody is looking at would put 4.7× the collectors on
// every router in a fleet, and the documented bottleneck is concurrent API
// channels on the MikroTik rather than CPU. So this is a different object, not
// a tuned-down one.
//
// ── WIRING IT IS AN OPERATOR DECISION; BUILDING IT IS NOT ───────────────────
//
// Whether a Go pool may run DURING COEXISTENCE is open — Node already runs one
// against the same fleet, so both would connect to every router at once. That
// decision is recorded during the port and is not made here. The code is needed
// under every option, including "wait for cutover", so it is written and pinned
// now and constructed by nobody — the same arrangement as
// `internal/history.Bucketer`.

import "sort"

// PoolAction is what a Sync concluded: which routers to start a background
// session for, and which to tear down.
//
// Both lists are SORTED. The live pool iterates a Map, so its order is insertion
// order; Go's map order is random, and a caller that connected in a different
// order every sync would be needlessly hard to reason about in a log. Nothing
// depends on the order — each start and stop is independent — so sorting is free
// and makes the decision reproducible.
type PoolAction struct {
	Start []string
	Stop  []string

// SyncPool decides which background sessions should exist.
//
// `all` is every router the app knows that is not disabled. `excluded` is the
// set the MAIN pool is already serving — a router with somebody looking at it
// must NOT also get a background session, or every up/down transition would be
// recorded twice and the router would carry two connections. `tracked` is what
// the pool holds today.
//
// A router that is both tracked and excluded is STOPPED, not left running: the
// exclusion means somebody opened it, and the main session took over.

	// The Devices page read that as "offline, with no reason to give" and drew a

// not start collectors on an in-flight event arriving after the teardown — the

// removed router keeps polling for ever. And a SUSPENDED pool connects without
// starting: suspension is "stop collecting", not "disconnect", so the sockets

// a `running` flag and returned whether there had been anything to stop — an
// invention, and the corpus caught it: the live pool logs three stops even for a
// session that never connected. A stop on a stopped collector is a no-op, and

// with the collectors themselves.
