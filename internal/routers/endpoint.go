// `sameEndpoint` — whether a stored router password may be reused for a
// connection test.
//
// ── THE WHOLE SECURITY PROPERTY OF /api/routers/test ────────────────────────
//
// The live comment names the attack: "A bare 'look it up by id' turns this
// route into a credential oracle: submit a stored id with an attacker-chosen
// host and the server posts the saved password to it."
//
// So the stored secret is reused only when every field deciding WHERE it goes
// and HOW it travels is unchanged — host, port and username for the first;
// TLS and its certificate check for the second. `tlsInsecure` matters as much
// as the host: turning it on accepts any certificate, which makes the same
// hostname a man-in-the-middle.
//
// Being a global admin gates the route and is explicitly NOT sufficient. The
// point is to stop a stored secret reaching a destination nobody stored it
// against, INCLUDING at the hands of an admin.
//
// NOTHING HERE READS A PASSWORD. This decides only whether the caller may.

import "strings"

// Endpoint is the five fields that decide whether two records name the same
// destination reached the same way. NOTHING ELSE BELONGS HERE — a label or a
// site does not change where a password goes, and including one would make
// admins retype after a rename.
//
// The three that arrive as JSON keep their raw form, because their COERCION is
// part of the rule rather than a detail of parsing: see each helper below.
