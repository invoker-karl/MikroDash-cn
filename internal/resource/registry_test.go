// ── EVERY RESOURCE'S `Page` MUST BE A LIVE PAGE KEY ────────────────────────
//
// `Page` is not a label. It is the RBAC key, and both gates that read it refuse
// an unknown page BEFORE they consult any role:
//
//	Session.CanPage   `s.Pages[page]` is absent  → deny
//	rbac.CanPage      `r.pages[page]` is false   → deny, before the builtin
//	                  short circuit, so not even an administrator gets through
//
// So a `Page` naming a renamed key does not degrade — it denies everyone with an
// identity, and only `AuthMode: "none"` (which short-circuits to true) still
// works. That is the worst possible shape for a bug: it behaves perfectly on the
// install with authentication switched off, which is where most testing happens.
//
// IT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED. `wifiNet`, `wlNet` and `wlSecProfile` declared
// `Page: "wifi"` after the 2026-09-01 rename moved that key to `wifi-networks`.
// Because `resSchema` is gated on READ, the WiFi Networks page did not merely
// refuse writes: it never received a schema, so no Add button was drawn and
// clicking a row did nothing. Nothing logged, nothing errored.
//
// CLAUDE.md's page-key table calls the permission meaning "the dangerous one"
// and records `rbac.PageKeys` being fixed to read `internal/pages` so it could
// not drift again. This is the same medicine one layer out: the registry is now
// compared against the same source, so a rename that misses a resource fails
// here instead of in the field.
