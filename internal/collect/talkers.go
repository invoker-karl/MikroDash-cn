// Top Talkers — per-device throughput, from Kid Control.
//
// ── IT IS NOT A TRAFFIC MENU ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The source is `/ip/kid-control/device`, which RouterOS ships as a parental
// control feature and which happens to maintain a per-MAC rate counter. That is
// the only place RouterOS offers per-device throughput without running Torch, so
// the live app uses it and so does this. Two consequences follow and both are
// visible in the payload: a router with no kid-control menu reports
// `available: false` rather than an empty list, and the names are whatever the
// operator typed into Kid Control rather than DHCP hostnames.
//
// ── THE ROWS ARE KEYED BY MAC, AND THAT IS A DEDUPLICATION ──────────────────
//
// The live collector stores rows in a Map keyed by `mac-address`, so a menu
// listing the same MAC twice keeps the LAST row and reports one device. A row
// with no MAC is dropped entirely — there is nothing to key it by, and a device
// that cannot be identified cannot be shown as a talker.
//
// ── UNAVAILABILITY LATCHES, SUCCESS DOES NOT UNLATCH IT ─────────────────────
//
// "unknown command" or "no such item" means this router has no kid-control menu,
// which is a property of the RouterOS build rather than a transient failure. The
// live collector sets a latch and stops asking; a later successful tick clears
// the retry backoff but NOT the latch, and its comment says why — clearing it
// there "un-latched the feature probe almost immediately". Any other error is
// transient and simply leaves the previous payload standing.

// clears it, called by the dormancy supervisor on backoff expiry and page focus.

// This port has no dormancy supervisor, and `Reconnected` is its re-probe. The
// convention is set by every other collector here and stated in session.go: "a
// reconnect must drop every 'this menu is absent' latch, because the usual
