// VPN collector — the port of src/collectors/vpn.js.
//
//	/interface/wireguard/peers   the WireGuard peers
//	/ppp/active                  L2TP, PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN sessions
//	/ip/ipsec/active-peers       the IPsec peers
//	/ip/ipsec/installed-sa       and the ciphers they negotiated
//
// ── THE PRE-SHARED KEY IS NOT IN THE PAYLOAD, AND MUST NEVER BE ──────────────
//
// `public-key` is here because a public key is public by construction, and the
// write path round-trips it to prove a row is still the one the operator was
// looking at. `preshared-key` is the secret half: the form's `secret` type never
// reads one back and the audit trail masks it on name alone. Putting it in this
// payload would send it to every viewer of the VPN page.
//
// /ppp/secret is not read at all, for the same reason it is not read in ppp.go —
// it stores account passwords in clear text, and the active session list already
// carries everything worth showing.
//
// ── HANDSHAKE AGE IS THE LIVENESS SIGNAL ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// WireGuard re-keys roughly every two minutes while a peer is actually passing
// traffic, so the AGE of the last handshake is the only real evidence a tunnel
// is up. An earlier rule asked "has this peer ever handshaken", which counted a
// peer that vanished days ago as connected and contradicted the page, which was
// already grading the same value by age and drawing it red. The thresholds here
// match that badge: under three minutes is active, older is stale, never is
// never.
//
// ── RATES ARE ZERO HERE, NOT NULL ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Unlike ppp.go, a first sample reports 0 rather than null. That is the original
// behaviour and it is reproduced rather than harmonised: the two collectors were
// written at different times and the VPN page has always rendered a number.
// Changing it would be a visible difference for no defect.

	// all three slow menus on the fast lane. THE POLLED PATH NEVER DID THAT: its
	// loop body is `RefreshNow`, WireGuard alone, and `loadOther` ran about once
	// a minute. So mechanism A tripled this collector's cost when it landed in
	// 3.2a, and nothing noticed because `vpn` only ran for a router somebody was
	// watching, where the extra reads sat inside a much larger total.
	//
	// MEASURED, once sessions began running it for unwatched routers: wireguard
	// 11/min against the polled path's 13, but ppp 12 against 1 and the two IPsec
	// menus 8 each against 1.
	//
	// `vpnSlowTarget` rather than `pollMs`, matching `ifStatusMetaTarget`. A
	// tunnel state change is now seen within thirty seconds instead of five --
