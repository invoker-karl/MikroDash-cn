// The one menu two collectors read, and the rule that lets them share it.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A METHOD ON EITHER COLLECTOR ──────────
//
// `/interface/monitor-traffic` is wanted by `ifStatus`, which reads a SNAPSHOT
// of every enabled interface's rates on its own cadence, and by `traffic`, which
// wants EVERY ROW as it arrives for the interfaces somebody is watching — which
// may include a disabled one, because a viewer can select it.
//
// Neither set contains the other, so this is a merge and not a subscription to
// somebody else's channel. Putting the rule on either collector would make that
// collector the authority on the other's needs, which is the coupling the two
// separate channels were avoiding in the first place.
//
// `roscache` deliberately does not know it: `=interface=` being a comma list and
// `=interval=` being a minimum are facts about THIS menu, and a cache that
// learned them would learn the next menu's rule as a second special case.
const monitorTrafficMenu = "/interface/monitor-traffic"

// monitorTrafficProps is the union of what the two holders read.
//
// `running` and `disabled` are `traffic`'s: its samples carry link state so the
// chart can grey a downed interface. `ifStatus` ignores them, and carrying two
// fields it does not read is free — one channel with a wider proplist is
// strictly cheaper than two channels.
const monitorTrafficProps = "=.proplist=name,rx-bits-per-second,tx-bits-per-second,running,disabled"

// monitorTrafficCmd builds one holder's claim.
//
// The interface list is SORTED, so a given set produces a stable command and the
// merge restarts the channel on a real change rather than on map iteration
// order. Both callers sort their own list too; doing it here as well is what
// makes that a property of the command rather than of each caller remembering.

// mergeMonitorTraffic is the rule `roscache` applies on every join and release.
//
// ── THE UNION, AND THE FINEST INTERVAL ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The union because a holder must never lose an interface it asked for: dropping
// one leaves a chart empty or a throughput column blank, silently, and nothing
// errors because the channel is perfectly healthy for everybody else.
//
// The finest interval because a merged channel delivers at one rate and the
// faster holder is the one with something to lose. `traffic` draws a point per
// second; `ifStatus` reads a snapshot whenever it ticks, so a channel finer than
// its own cadence costs it nothing and gains it freshness. B.0 measured every
// interface at one second as 2.6 KB/s with no measurable CPU, which is what
// makes "take the finest" affordable rather than a compromise.
