// The global `conn:update` OMITS the four heavy indexes; the replay CARRIES them.
//
// ── THE DEFECT THIS PINS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The live collector builds the light payload with `delete emitPayload.countryDests`
// and three more, which REMOVES the keys. The port set the fields to nil, and a
// nil Go map marshals as `null` — so the port sent `"countryDests": null` where
// the live app sends no key at all.
//
// The port therefore had ONE conn:update key set where the live app has TWO, which
// is exactly what the live-socket-diff tool reported on 2026-08-28 as "a second
// payload shape on the live side that the port does not produce".
//
// ── WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS WRONG ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `omitempty` on the four fields would drop them from the REPLAY too, whenever
// the maps were empty. The live `lastPayload` assigns all four unconditionally,
// so the Connections page would open on a payload missing keys the live one has.
// A struct tag cannot say "absent in one emit, present in the other".
