package collect

// A collector's subscription to one menu, with the poll-loop fallback.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Phase 3.2 moves collectors off their own timers: instead of owning a loop, a
// collector declares that it WANTS a menu at a cadence, and the router's one
// scheduler decides when to read it. `netwatch` and `talkers` were migrated by
// hand first, and doing two was enough to see that the interesting part is the
// same every time and the fiddly part is the same every time.
//
// The fiddly part is the fallback. BOTH BACKGROUND POOLS BUILD COLLECTORS WITH
// NO CACHE -- a router nobody is watching still needs netwatch for its alerts --
// so every migrated collector must keep working unchanged when `cache == nil`.
// Written out per collector that is four branches to get right in each of Start,
// Suspend, Resume, Reconnected and Stop, twenty times over. Written once it is
// this file, and a migration becomes a field plus five one-line delegations.
//
// ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One menu AT A TIME. A collector reading several -- and most read several -- subscribes
// to the one whose cadence drives it, and reads the rest inside its own `apply`,
// through the cache, exactly as it did before. Modelling "derive when all of
// these are fresh" is a real question and it belongs to phase 4.2's views, not
// to a helper that exists to stop five lifecycle methods being copied.
//
// WHICH menu may change while running -- see `resubscribe` -- but there is still
// only ever one.

	//	streamArgs  the arguments the channel is opened with. Defaults to the
	//	            cadence as `=interval=` plus this subscription's proplist, so
	//	            a streamed menu asks for exactly what the polled one did.

// exactly as it was, which is a working polled collector. The alternative is
// surfacing an error for a delivery mechanism the operator asked for and the
// hardware declined, on a page that is rendering correctly.

// resubscribe points the collector at a different menu, with the callback that
// knows how to read it.
//
// ── MECHANISM B: A MENU CHOSEN AT RUNTIME ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `begin`/`end` assume the collector knows its menu when it is constructed.
// Three do not. The firewall refreshes the counters of whichever TABLE the
// operator is looking at; `wifi` and `wireless` read whichever WIRELESS STACK
// the router turned out to have, which is not known until it answers. A
// subscription is per-menu, so those collectors need to be able to move one.
//
// ── WHY IT TAKES THE CALLBACK TOO, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ──────────
//
// The delivered rows say nothing about which menu they came from. So a callback
// that resolves that itself -- reading the collector's "current table" field --
// can be handed the OLD menu's rows after the field has already moved, and merge
// nat counters into the filter table. The rows are keyed by RouterOS `.id`, and
// `*1` exists in every menu, so that merge SUCCEEDS and produces silently wrong
// numbers for one frame.
//
// Binding the callback to the menu at the moment of subscription removes the
// question. The caller passes a closure that already knows its table; nothing
// has to be resolved later, so nothing can be resolved late.
//
// ── ORDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Release first, then subscribe. The demand set counts subscribers per menu and
// stops reading a menu that has none, so releasing first is what makes the old
// menu actually go quiet.
//
// Releasing does NOT drain a delivery already under way. `Cache.deliver` copies
// the callbacks out and drops the lock before calling them, so an old-menu
// delivery can still land after the release returns. That is precisely why the
// callback is bound above rather than resolved later: the ordering cannot be
// relied on, so nothing is allowed to depend on it.
//
// A no-op when the menu has not changed, so a caller may pass its current
// selection unconditionally. Safe while suspended: it records the choice and
// `begin` picks it up.
