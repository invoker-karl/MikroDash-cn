package collect

// The bandwidth differential gate.
//
// tools/bandwidth-cases.js drives the LIVE collector over the captured
// connection table twice — once as recorded, once with the byte counters
// advanced on a fixed rule — and records what it made of both. This replays the
// same two snapshots through the Go transform and requires the same answer.
//
// It is a generator rather than a fixture because this collector performs no
// router I/O at all: there is nothing to capture. See the generator's header.

// guard to test any more because every delivery is a fresh read. What is left to
