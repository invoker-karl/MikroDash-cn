// The two suites assert the SAME behaviour against the two implementations, so
// they cannot drift apart silently. They were written asserting the OPPOSITE:
// a comment-only edit used to write the router and never reach the open page,
// because the fingerprint was a hand-listed tuple that omitted `comment`. The
// port found that, it was fixed in the live app, and these tests going red is
// how the port was told to follow. They now pin the fixed behaviour.
