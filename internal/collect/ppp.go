// PPP collector — the port of src/collectors/ppp.js (issue #32, "Live PPPoE
// Metrics").
//
//	/ppp/active                     the sessions
//	/ppp/profile                    the profiles they were assigned
//	/interface/pppoe-server/server  the PPPoE servers that accept them
//	/ppp/secret                     the accounts themselves, MINUS THE PASSWORD
//
// ── THE PASSWORD IS NEVER READ. THE REST OF THE MENU NOW IS ─────────────────
//
// This file used to say "/ppp/secret IS NEVER READ", and the reason recorded
// with it (CHANGELOG, issue #64) was two claims joined by "and":
//
//	it holds credentials, and the active list already carries everything
//	worth showing.
//
// Only the first survives. The second was true of a MONITORING page and is
// false of a MANAGEMENT one — managing subscribers is precisely the thing the
// active list cannot do (issue #125).
//
// So the rule is NARROWED, not reversed. `pppSecretCmd` names every property
// this page needs and does NOT name `password`, and that absence is the whole
// security property: a password cannot reach a browser through a payload it was
// never read into. Writes go the other way entirely, through
// `internal/resource`'s `TypeSecret`, which is write-only by construction.
//
// `TestNoProplistNamesACredential` enforces this now. It is worth knowing that
// the sentence this replaces claimed "a test enforces it across both" — that
// test was the Node original's and went at cutover, so the rule spent the whole
// port with nothing holding it up.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The property is "no password reaches a BROWSER", not "no password is ever
// read". The write path is a separate road: `internal/server`'s `readMenu`
// prints the whole menu with NO proplist — deliberately, because `ReadOnlyWhen`
// needs properties no page asks for — so a save, a delete or an enable does pull
// cleartext passwords into server memory for the length of that call. They stop
// there: `RowValues` drops every secret-typed field, `PreviewCommand` masks it,
// and the audit trail masks it by type. Narrowing that read too is a change to
// shared machinery and belongs in its own piece of work; what must not happen is
// this comment being read as covering it.
//
// ── RATES ARE DERIVED, AND null IS NOT ZERO ──────────────────────────────────
//
// RouterOS reports cumulative bytes only, so per-user bandwidth — the actual ask
// in #32 — comes from differencing two readings. The FIRST sample of a session
// therefore has no rate at all, and that is reported as null rather than 0:
// there is no measurement window yet, and 0 would claim an idle session that may
// be saturating the line.
//
// Two further rules, both carried over intact:
//
//   - the rate is clamped at 0, because a session that reconnects restarts its
//     counters and a negative rate is worse than a missed sample;
//   - the baseline timestamp advances ONLY when the bytes actually moved, so the
//     window always spans a real interval even when polls land between counter
//     updates. Bytes unchanged for longer than the idle threshold then read as
//     idle rather than as "still at the last rate".
//
// ── NOT VERIFIED AGAINST HARDWARE ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The Node header says so and it is still true here: the fleet runs no PPP, so
// /ppp/active returns the empty-menu junk row and every session-shaped field
// comes from the RouterOS field reference and the fixture. The EMPTY state is
// the only part real hardware has exercised — on either side.

// ── A CARD WITH NOTHING TO SAY WAS BEING CALLED STALE ──────────────────────

// The emit is gated on a fingerprint, so an unchanged tick sends nothing. That
// is right for bandwidth and wrong for LIVENESS, because the browser measures
// staleness as "how long since a payload arrived" and cannot tell a collector
// that is quiet from one that has stopped.
//
// The two contracts only conflict where the data can be genuinely static, and
// PPP is exactly that: a router with no sessions and no configuration changes
// produces an identical fingerprint for ever. So the first frame arrived, the
// timer ran, and 25 seconds later the Active Sessions card wore a "stale" badge
// while the collector was polling perfectly happily. Reported from the live
// install, on the routers that run no PPP at all.
//
// FIFTEEN SECONDS IS NOT ARBITRARY. `web/src/stale.ts` retunes each card's
// threshold to `pollMs + STALE_GRACE`, and STALE_GRACE is 20 s, so the smallest
// threshold this collector can face is its 2 s poll floor plus 20 s. A heartbeat
// below that is safe at every interval `clampPoll` allows, and 15 s clears the
// tightest case with room to spare. A slower poll simply emits on every tick,
// which is what it did before the dirty check existed.

// tick still sends nothing, which on a 2 s poll is seven frames saved in eight.
