// Traffic collector — live per-interface throughput.
//
//	/interface/monitor-traffic =interface=<list> =interval=1
//
// THE STREAM COVERS ONLY WHAT IS BEING WATCHED, plus the default interface,
// which is always included because the WAN status badge reads it on every page.
// A router with forty interfaces is not forty streams: the subscription set is
// refcounted and the stream is restarted when it actually changes.
//
// This is the SECOND streaming collector, after logs, and for the same reason:
// `monitor-traffic` with an interval is a push channel by design, and polling it
// would mean asking the router to start and stop a measurement every second.
//
// ── AND `=interval=` HERE IS NOT THE `=interval=` ON A PRINT ────────────────
//
// A `monitor` command is ONE OPEN RESULT SET whose sections increment; a
// `print =interval=N` is a REPEATED print, and each repetition completes with
// its own `!done`. That difference decides whether this stream survives.
//
// `internal/routeros.Stream` ends when go-routeros closes the listen channel,
// which it does on `!done` — so if this command sent one per cycle, the chart
// would stop after one second. It does not. Measured on the hAP AC2 under 7.24,
// while investigating something else entirely:
//
//	[   5.248ms] !re | =.section=0
//	[1009.879ms] !re | =.section=1
//	[2017.518ms] !re | =.section=2
//	[3019.330ms] !re | =.section=3
//	[3503.877ms] !done   <- the only one, and only after /cancel
//
// So the cycle marker here is `.section`, not `!done`.
//
// `.section` IS STAMPED ON BOTH SHAPES — confirmed on the AC2 with
// `/interface/print =interval=3`, where nine packets share a section and it
// increments per cycle. So it is the delimiter to build on if these reads are
// ever unified, and it is the only one that works for both: a boundary built on
// `!done` never fires for a monitor, and one built on a repeated key is wrong
// for `/ip/address/print`, where an interface legitimately appears more than
// once per cycle. The live app hit the mirror image of this as its issue
// #119 — a collector that needed a cycle boundary on a PRINT-shaped stream,
// where the `!done` exists and its vendored library discards it.
//
// ── SAMPLES ARE KEPT WHETHER ANYONE IS WATCHING OR NOT ──────────────────────
//
// The ring buffer is filled on every packet, so a browser that connects gets
// history immediately rather than a blank chart that fills over the next minute.
// Only the per-viewer emit is gated on somebody being there.

// this history by discarding the whole collector.
//
// So the clear never protected against the thing it named, and it cost the

//
// `/interface/monitor-traffic` pushes a row a second and nothing acknowledges
// it. A router that stops sending — after an upgrade, a CPU spike, a menu
// briefly disappearing — leaves a connection that is open, a client that
// reports Connected, and a chart that simply stops moving. Nothing errors, so
// nothing retries, and the only cure was for the operator to force a reconnect.
// Reported on issue #126 as a router that "disconnects" and comes back only
// when the device is deleted and added again. This is `_startWatchdog` in
// src/collectors/traffic.js, added in PR #91 for issues #55 and #90.
//
// ── THE RESTARTING MOVED, THE REPORTING DID NOT ────────────────────────────
//
// The channel is `roscache`'s now and so is its recovery: `streamFill.watch`
// reopens a fill that has gone quiet, and it does it for all fourteen streamed
// menus instead of this one. Keeping a second watchdog here would mean two
// things racing to restart one channel, and the loser would find a stream it
// had not opened.
//
// What could NOT move is the health signal. `stream:health` tints the traffic
// card on the Dashboard and names a restart count — a real feature, and the
// restart count is now somebody else's counter. So this tick DETECTS a restart
// instead of performing one, and feeds the same `StreamHealth` state machine it
// always did.
//
// ── AND ONE THING THE FILL DOES NOT DO: RETRY A FAILED OPEN ────────────────
//
// `JoinStream` returns an error when the channel will not open, and leaves no
// fill behind — so there is nothing for its watchdog to watch. That retry was
// this loop's second job and it stays here, because it is about whether this
// collector HAS a holder, which is a question only this collector can ask.

// Seed fills the history ring for one interface from somewhere that already has

//
// ── PHASE 5.1: WHERE THE POINTS COME FROM, AND WHY NOT THE DATABASE ─────────
//
// A Session is reference counted and built when the first viewer arrives, so its
// ring is EMPTY at that moment and no amount of priming fills it faster than real
// time. The points have to come from something that already holds them.
//
// The history DATABASE looks like that something and is not: `internal/history`
// buckets to one row per interface per MINUTE, carrying the minute's mean, while
// this ring is per-second with `maxPoints = historyMinutes * 60`. A five-minute
// window wants three hundred points and the database can offer five.
//
// The BACKGROUND POOL is the right source. It runs this same collector for every
// router with reporting enabled, streaming continuously on a connection it
// already holds, so its ring is per-second and current -- and a live Session
// displaces that pool, which is exactly when the copy should happen.
//
// ── IT NEVER OVERWRITES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A non-empty ring is live data this collector produced, and it is always better
// than a seed. Seeding is for the blank case only, so a late or duplicated call
// is a no-op rather than a rewind.
//
// `lastData` is deliberately NOT touched. That field is the STREAM WATCHDOG's,
// and telling it a seed was traffic would suppress the restart that recovers a
// stream which died silently -- a different question from whether the chart has
// anything to draw.
