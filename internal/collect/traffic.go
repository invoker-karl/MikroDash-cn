// Traffic collector — live per-interface throughput.
//
//	/interface/monitor-traffic =interface=<list> =interval=1
//
// THE STREAM COVERS ONLY WHAT IS BEING WATCHED, plus the default interface,
// which is always included because the WAN status badge reads it on every page.
// A router with forty interfaces is not forty streams: the subscription set is
// refcounted and the stream is restarted when it actually changes.
//
// This is the SECOND streaming collector, after logs, and for the same reason:
// `monitor-traffic` with an interval is a push channel by design, and polling it
// would mean asking the router to start and stop a measurement every second.
//
// ── AND `=interval=` HERE IS NOT THE `=interval=` ON A PRINT ────────────────
//
// A `monitor` command is ONE OPEN RESULT SET whose sections increment; a
// `print =interval=N` is a REPEATED print, and each repetition completes with
// its own `!done`. That difference decides whether this stream survives.
//
// `internal/routeros.Stream` ends when go-routeros closes the listen channel,
// which it does on `!done` — so if this command sent one per cycle, the chart
// would stop after one second. It does not. Measured on the hAP AC2 under 7.24,
// while investigating something else entirely:
//
//	[   5.248ms] !re | =.section=0
//	[1009.879ms] !re | =.section=1
//	[2017.518ms] !re | =.section=2
//	[3019.330ms] !re | =.section=3
//	[3503.877ms] !done   <- the only one, and only after /cancel
//
// So the cycle marker here is `.section`, not `!done`.
//
// `.section` IS STAMPED ON BOTH SHAPES — confirmed on the AC2 with
// `/interface/print =interval=3`, where nine packets share a section and it
// increments per cycle. So it is the delimiter to build on if these reads are
// ever unified, and it is the only one that works for both: a boundary built on
// `!done` never fires for a monitor, and one built on a repeated key is wrong
// for `/ip/address/print`, where an interface legitimately appears more than
// once per cycle. The live app hit the mirror image of this as its issue
// #119 — a collector that needed a cycle boundary on a PRINT-shaped stream,
// where the `!done` exists and its vendored library discards it.
//
// ── SAMPLES ARE KEPT WHETHER ANYONE IS WATCHING OR NOT ──────────────────────
//
// The ring buffer is filled on every packet, so a browser that connects gets
// history immediately rather than a blank chart that fills over the next minute.
// Only the per-viewer emit is gated on somebody being there.

// `connectLoop`, inside a Session -- and a Session is built per router ID and
// held in `Manager.live` under that key. A DIFFERENT router is a different
// Session, reached by releasing this one and acquiring that one, which discards
// this history by discarding the whole collector.
//
// So the clear never protected against the thing it named, and it cost the
// operator the chart: a router reconnect is routine (an upgrade, a brief drop,
// and `connectLoop` retries every 5s), and each one restarted the traffic graph
// from nothing. That is what "clears and starts drawing from scratch" was.
//
// ── WHAT IS GIVEN UP, DELIBERATELY ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The samples either side of the gap are now both in the ring, so the chart
// draws one straight segment across however long the router was away. That is a
// visible artefact and it is the better trade: it is honest about time, it is
// bounded by the ring's own window, and it costs one misleading segment instead
// of every point the operator was looking at.
