// Reading through the coalescing cache, when a session has given us one.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A HELPER AND NOT A CHANGED Reader ───────────────────────────
//
// `roscache.Get` needs the menu, the fields and a staleness tolerance as three
// separate things; `Reader.Do` takes an opaque `routeros.Cmd`. Rather than
// change every collector's constructor and every fixture harness that builds
// one, this pulls the proplist back out of the command the collector already
// declares. The `routeros.Cmd` vars at the top of each collector stay THE one
// statement of what that collector wants, which is what stops a field list being
// written down twice and drifting.
//
// ── A NIL CACHE IS THE NORMAL CASE, NOT AN ERROR ────────────────────────────
//
// Fixture replay, the differential golden and every unit test construct
// collectors with a fake Reader and no cache. They must keep reading exactly as
// before, or a caching bug would look like a collector bug. So nil falls through
// to `ros.Do` and nothing else changes.

// readVia reads a command through the cache, or directly when there is none.
//
// ── ONLY TABLE READS ARE CACHEABLE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A command carrying any argument other than a plain field list is passed
// straight through. That is not caution for its own sake, and it is not really a
// caching rule at all: an interval argument makes it a STREAM, a once argument a
// MEASUREMENT taken at an instant, and a filter argument a narrower question
// about the same menu. Caching any of them by menu alone would hand one
// collector another's answer, to a question it did not ask, about a moment it
// did not choose.
//
// `acquisition.go` is where that distinction is named and where its consequences
// are set out. This helper is one of its two consumers.
//
// (The field-list prefix is deliberately not written out in this comment. The
// credential gate in internal/verify scans source text for it and cannot tell
// prose from code, so spelling it here made this file look like it was asking a
// router for a field called "is passed straight through". CLAUDE.md records that
// trap: write the example so the checker does not recognise it.)

//
// TWO CONDITIONS, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. The first is the SHAPE OF
// THE DATA: only a Query is a table read, and only a table read has an answer
// two consumers can share. See acquisition.go for why that is not a caching
// detail but the thing being modelled. The second is narrower and merely
// practical: even among queries, this cache keys by menu alone, so a command
// carrying anything beyond a field list is asking a narrower question than its
// menu name and must not be served a broader answer.
//
// `/interface/wireguard/peers` is the one live example of the second: a Query
// that asks for full detail, so it is cacheable in principle and not by THIS
// cache. It has one consumer, so nothing is lost.
//
// No args means "every field", which IS cacheable — as the widest possible
// union. See roscache.Get.
