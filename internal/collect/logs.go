//	/log/listen   a PUSH STREAM: RouterOS sends each entry as it is written
//
// THE ONLY STREAMING COLLECTOR IN THE PORT, and the one place where a stream is
// clearly right. Everything else here polls, because a poll costs one channel
// for a moment and a stream holds one open — but a log has no "current state" to
// read: polling /log/print would mean re-reading the whole buffer every tick and
// keeping a seen-set to work out what was new. The listen channel makes both
// unnecessary, which is exactly what the Node original says it is for.
//
// The history is a RING BUFFER, not a growing slice. A busy router writes
// continuously, and the page shows a window; keeping everything would be a leak
// with a log level attached to it.

//
// IDEMPOTENT, and that is required rather than tidy: `applyDemand` calls
