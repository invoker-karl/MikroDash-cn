package collect

// What the fixture cannot say.
//
// `TestGoldenPayloads` replays 64 real rows and pins the whole payload against
// what the Node collector made of them — which is the strongest check available
// and still blind to anything that router happened not to have. Deliberately
// breaking the "drop a row with no MAC" rule left the golden green, because all
// 64 rows had one.
//
// So these are the shapes a capture cannot be relied on to contain: a row
// missing its key, the same key twice, an empty name, a rate that is not a
// number, and more devices than the cut. The fixture proves the port agrees with
// the original on real data; this proves it agrees on the data the original
// guards against.
