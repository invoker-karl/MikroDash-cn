// The traffic stream's silent-death recovery, after B.7 split it in two.
//
// ── THE FAILURE IT EXISTS FOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `/interface/monitor-traffic` pushes a row a second and nothing acknowledges
// it. A router that stops sending leaves an open connection, a client reporting
// Connected, and a chart that has simply stopped. Nothing errors, so nothing
// retries. Reported on issue #126 as a router that "disconnects" and returns
// only when the device is deleted and re-added.
//
// ── WHAT MOVED, AND WHAT THESE TESTS ASSERT NOW ────────────────────────────
//
// The channel is shared with `ifStatus` since B.7, so the RESTARTING is
// `roscache`'s: one watchdog for all fourteen streamed menus instead of a second
// one here racing it. `internal/roscache` owns those tests.
//
// Two jobs stayed, because only this collector can do them:
//
//	the failed-open retry   `JoinStream` returning an error leaves NO fill, so
//	                        there is nothing for the shared watchdog to watch
//	the health signal       `stream:health` tints the Dashboard's traffic card
//	                        and names a restart count that is now somebody
//	                        else's counter
//
// So these drive the tick directly and, where a restart is the subject, drive it
// END TO END: the fake router goes silent, `roscache` restarts the fill, and this
// collector turns the rising count into one transition. `Cache.StreamTimings`
// is what makes that take milliseconds instead of a minute a case.
