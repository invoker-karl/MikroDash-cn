// Interface status — the port of src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js.
//
// POLLED HERE, STREAMED THERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The Node collector holds
// three `=interval=N` channels open for its metadata (/interface, /ip/address,
// /interface/ethernet) and a fourth for rates. This reads the same four menus
// with ordinary prints on one connection. CLAUDE.md is explicit that "more
// efficient means fewer router channels, not faster payload assembly", and
// src/collection.js records the evidence: "the evidence in #104 points at
// concurrent open channels rather than data volume". Four fewer channels per
// router is the single biggest saving available in this port, and the payload is
// identical either way — a `=interval=N` print re-sends the same rows a plain
// print returns.
//
// The mechanism changed; the payload did not. That is the line CLAUDE.md draws.
//
// AND IT BUYS COMPLETENESS, WHICH IS NOT WHY IT WAS DONE. A `Do` returns a reply
// set the protocol itself terminates with `!done`; a persistent `=interval=N`
// stream hands over packets with no boundary the caller can see. So a delimited
// read is a COMPLETENESS GUARANTEE and a stream is not — which is a second and
// stronger reason for this departure than the channel count that motivated it.
//
// That is not hypothetical. The live app hit it as issue #119: its streaming
// version of this collector used a 300ms debounce to decide a cycle had ended,
// a debounce measures silence rather than completeness, and one mid-cycle gap
// installed a partial interface list as the whole truth — the traffic dropdown
// lost all but one interface on a CCR2004. This collector cannot have that bug,
// and not by foresight.
//
// IF THAT EVER CHANGES, THE FIX IS IN THE ADAPTER, NOT HERE. `internal/routeros`
// ends a Stream when go-routeros closes the channel, which it does on `!done` —
// so an `=interval=N` read would look like a stream that ended after one cycle.
// Adopting streaming for these menus means first surfacing the per-cycle `!done`
// as an event rather than an ending.
//
// RATES COME FROM THE ROUTER, NOT FROM DIFFERENCING BYTE COUNTERS.
// /interface/monitor-traffic reports rx-bits-per-second directly, and it can
// only be asked once the interface list is known — so the order within a tick is
// metadata first, rates second.
//
// ── THE FOUR READS ARE SPLIT, BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THEM MOVES ────────────────
//
// This collector was four commands on every tick, and its tick is the fastest
// in the app. Measured against one idle CHR at the default cadence: 267 commands
// a minute reached the router, and 204 of them — 76% — were these four. That is
// what MikroDash costs a router when nobody is doing anything.
//
// Three of the four answer questions that do not change at that speed. An
// interface's name, type, comment, MAC, addresses and driver error counters do
// not move between one second and the next; asking 51 times a minute buys
// nothing. Only /interface/monitor-traffic answers a question whose whole value
// is that it is current.
//
// So the metadata reads are re-run every `metaTicks` polls and the rates read
// every poll, and a tick publishes the held metadata with the rates it just
// fetched. `metaTicks` targets `ifStatusMetaTarget` and is DERIVED from the poll
// interval rather than configured, so an operator who slows this collector down
// never gets metadata faster than rates, and one who speeds it up does not
// multiply the metadata cost with it.
//
// WHAT IS TRADED: `running`, `disabled` and the counters are up to
// `ifStatusMetaTarget` late. A link that drops is noticed within that window
// rather than within a poll — on the Interfaces page, in the sidebar badge and
// in the traffic picker. Rates, which are the thing anybody actually watches
// move, are unchanged. See the constant for what the operator set it to and why.
//
// A POLL INTERVAL AT OR ABOVE THE TARGET COLLAPSES THIS BACK TO ONE LANE, which
// is not a coincidence to lean on: the frozen golden replay constructs this
// collector at 30s, so it takes that branch and reads all four menus on every
// tick exactly as before. The split is therefore NOT covered by the golden, and
// `TestIfStatusSplitsTheMetadataReads` is what covers it instead.

// tick every second, but the other three can be polled at let's say a 30 second
// cadence or longer". It was five while the split was being proved out.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, stated once so nobody rediscovers it as a bug: `running`,
// `disabled`, the addresses and the counters are up to 30 seconds old. A port
// that goes down is late on the Interfaces page, on the sidebar badge and in the
// traffic chart's picker, and an interface created on the router takes that long
// to appear. Rates are not affected — they are the other lane.
//
// AND `running` CANNOT BE MOVED TO THE FAST LANE, which was checked rather than
// assumed: `/interface/monitor-traffic` was run against live hardware and returns
// only rates and per-second packet, drop and error counts. There is no link state
// in it, so keeping link state current would mean a fifth command, which is the

// the rates it was given, which is the same behaviour as a router that stopped
