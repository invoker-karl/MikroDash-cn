// What a settings save applies to the RUNNING collectors.
//
// `POST /api/settings` does not only write the file: it re-tunes the live poll
// intervals, so moving a slider takes effect without a restart. Two rules decide
// that, and both are about what NOT to do — which is what makes them easy to
// port wrongly and invisible when they are.
//
// ── 1. A PER-ROUTER OVERRIDE OUTRANKS THE FLEET DEFAULT ─────────────────────
//
// The live comment (#105): "Without this the global save would silently un-pin
// whichever router the pool is currently serving, and the modal would then
// disagree with reality." A pinned key is still SAVED to the file; it is just
// not applied to the running collector. The two halves disagree on purpose.
//
// The test is PRESENCE, not truth — `overrides[key] !== undefined` — so an
// override of 0, of false or of "" still pins. A port checking truthiness
// un-pins exactly the values an operator sets to mean "off".
//
// ── 2. ONLY KEYS PRESENT IN THE UPDATES ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The updates, not the merged file. Every poll key is in the file, so a port
// reading that would re-tune all twenty-three collectors on every save,
// restarting streams nobody touched.
//
// ── 3. THE VALUE IS RE-CLAMPED, TO A DIFFERENT RANGE ────────────────────────
//
// 500..600000, which is neither the validator's range nor a superset of it:
// `pollRouting` validates at 500..300000 and `pollWifi` at 10000..600000. The
// second clamp exists because the stored value may predate the current bounds.
//
// Pinned by the settings-apply corpus, whose table is LIFTED from the
// route. That table is the part with a history: the live source records that
// `pollTopology`, `pollVlans` and `pollPpp` were once missing from it, so "the
// sliders existed and the bounds existed, but with no entry here the value was
// dropped on save and never reached the collector".

const (
	retuneFloor   = 500
	retuneCeiling = 600000

// Retune is one collector's new interval. KeepCurrent means the stored value was
// not a finite number and the collector's existing interval stands — which is
// not the same as an interval of zero, and not the same as being absent.

	PollMs      int
	KeepCurrent bool

// file so a poll key added upstream cannot be silently missing here.

// PollRetunes is what a save should apply, given the keys it changed, the merged
// file it produced, and this router's overrides.

// applied, and the stored value stays whatever it was.

		// ── ABSENT IS NOT NULL, AND GO'S MAP LOOKUP HIDES THAT ──────────────
		//
		// `saved[key]` on a missing Go key yields a nil `any`, which is exactly
		// what a key holding JSON null yields. JavaScript tells them apart and
		// the answers differ: `Number(undefined)` is NaN — keep the collector's
		// current interval — while `Number(null)` is 0, which is finite and
		// clamps to the floor of 500.
		//
		// So a missing interval must leave the collector alone and a null one
		// must set it to the fastest allowed. Reading the one-value form conflates
		// them and silently speeds up a collector whose setting was never
		// written. The corpus carries both cases; this was found by the missing
		// one answering 500.
