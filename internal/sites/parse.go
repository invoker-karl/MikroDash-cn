// What a site CREATE or EDIT is allowed to write — the port of `_parseSiteBody`.
//
// ── THE WHOLE DECISION IS ABSENT VERSUS NULL VERSUS SET ─────────────────────
//
// Three distinct inputs with three distinct outcomes:
//
//	absent  the caller did not touch it. LEAVE IT ALONE — which is what stops a
//	        rename from blanking a site's location.
//	null    an explicit "no location" / "no description".
//	set     a value, validated.
//
// AND GO'S `map[string]any` CANNOT TELL THE FIRST TWO APART: `m["place"]` is nil
// for a missing key and for a JSON null alike. This port has been caught by
// exactly that twice — `collection.PollRetunes` and `store.PageSettings` — so
// every read here asks `v, ok := m[k]` and branches on BOTH, never on `v == nil`
// alone. `Patch` carries the same distinction outward, as pointers-to-pointers
// would if they read tolerably; they do not, so it carries explicit `Has` flags.
//
// ── AND THE LOCATION MOVES AS FIVE COLUMNS OR NONE ──────────────────────────
//
// A site's location is a PICKED PLACE, not typed coordinates (#96). `lat`/`lon`
// survive as the plotted values but are DERIVED from the choice, which is why
// all five columns move together and a half-set location is unreachable. Top-
// level `lat`/`lon` in the body are ignored outright rather than written; a port
// that honoured them would make a half-set location reachable and put a site on
// the map at coordinates no gazetteer ever produced.
//
// Validation goes through `geoplace.NormalizePlace` — the same function the
// router store uses — so a site and a router cannot disagree about what a
// well-formed place is.

// exists", about a field the caller sent as empty — and `{"name": null}` is what
// a cleared form field serialises to, so it was reachable from the UI rather
// than only from curl. Filed as `ToDo.md` §6 and FIXED upstream on 2026-08-27;
// this port follows the fix rather than keeping the quirk, and
// The site-body corpus pins it.

// explicit NULL and is a different thing from an absent key.
//
// The five location columns appear together or not at all - see the note at the

// deliberate duplication, because the whitelist there is what keeps a column
// name out of SQL text and this map is not the only thing that could reach it.
