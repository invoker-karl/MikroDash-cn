// The Backups page's handlers: the state payload, the config diff, the schedule
// form's write, the operator delete, and the manual "Back Up Now".
//
// ── EVERY WRITE IS PORTED AND THE PAGE SHIPS ────────────────────────────────
//
// THIS HEADER HAS NOW BEEN WRONG TWICE, in the same way both times. It said "TWO
// WRITES REMAIN" while `backupsRun` sat a few hundred lines below it (corrected
// 2026-08-25), and then said "ONE WRITE REMAINS ... `backups:restore` ... that
// is why `backups` is still missing from `web/build.mjs`'s PAGES and `main.ts`'s
// PORTED set". All of that had expired too, and by then the page was shipping:
//
//   - The base-URL question was ANSWERED by the operator on 2026-08-25: Go owns
//     `/api/backups/:id/raw` outright. No new configuration, and `backupBaseUrl`
//     is not reinterpreted.
//   - `backups_raw.go` serves that route and `backups_restore.go` handles the
//     event; `ws.go` dispatches it.
//   - `backups` is in `build.mjs`'s PAGES and in `main.ts`'s PORTED, which says
//     so in its own comment.
//
// Corrected 2026-08-27 by measuring rather than reading. The recurring cause is
// that a note about something MISSING has no gate — nothing fails when the thing
// arrives, so only re-measuring finds it.
//
// ── DOWNLOADING IS A WRITE-LEVEL QUESTION ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `permitted` on the payload is `backups` at WRITE, not read — an export
// describes the whole network and the binary carries every key on the device.
// The page draws its download links from that flag, so getting it wrong here
// hands both to a viewer.
