// empty CPU, memory and uptime for the two seconds the overview pool takes to
// dial. Nothing errors and nothing logs, so the property has to be asserted
// where it is visible: the `routers:stats` frame a browser receives.
//
// ── WHAT THIS TEST LOST WHEN `internal/alertpool` WAS DELETED ──────────────
//
// It used to drive the WHOLE path: build a pool over a stub connection that
// answers `/system/resource/print`, sync it, wait for the sessions to observe,
// then call `devicesFocus` and read the FIRST frame off the socket. That
// asserted three things at once — the prime ran, it ran BEFORE the frame, and
// its reading reached the row.
//
// `session.Manager` has no dial seam. It calls `routeros.Dial` directly and
// holds a concrete `*routeros.Client`, so a test cannot give it a stub
// connection the way `alertpool.New` took a dialler; giving it one means putting
// the client behind an interface, which is a change to the hottest file in the
// tree and not something to do inside a deletion.
//
// SO THE COVERAGE IS SPLIT, DELIBERATELY, AND BOTH HALVES ARE NAMED:
//
//	the prime RUNS, on a focus, before the frame   `internal/verify/prime_test.go`
//	                                               (a source read of devicesFocus)
//	its reading REACHES the row                    here
