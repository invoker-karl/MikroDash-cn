// `/healthz` and the THIRD holder of a router.
//
// ── IT ASKED TWO SOURCES AND GAVE UP ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `activeRouterHealth` consulted the interactive sessions, then the held ones,
// then returned false. Three components can hold a router, and the one it did
// not ask is the one that holds it exactly when the other two do not:
// `warmExclusions` drops the WARM hold on every router the overview
// pool has ANSWERED for, and the manager forgets the status of a router it
// drops.
//
// So while anybody had the Devices page open, `/healthz` reported the active
// router disconnected — a 503 for a healthy install, which is how an
// orchestrator decides to restart a container.
//
// And it never recovered after a router edit: `routerUpdate` calls `syncPool`,
// which dials the whole fleet, and no release is scheduled because nobody was
// watching the Devices page to stop watching it. Measured against the shipped
// 0.8.18 on a real fleet: one edit, then `ok:false` for as long as the process
// ran, while an unmodified build of this change stayed true through the same
// sequence.

// healthPoolServer is a server whose ACTIVE router is held only by the overview
// pool — no interactive session, no held one.

// as red Offline on the Devices page, twice reported.
//
// The gate in `activeRouterHealth` is DEFENSIVE, and this test does not prove
// it: with the sessions consulted first, an unanswered summary and a skipped
// one both end at the same `return false`, so removing `sum.Known` changes no
// outcome and no test can kill that mutation. It is kept because it states the
// invariant every other reader of `Summaries()` uses, and because the order
// these three sources are consulted in is exactly the kind of thing that gets
// rearranged later — at which point the gate starts mattering and nobody would
// think to add it.

// never started watching.
//
// A SOURCE PIN, because the behaviour is a two-minute timer over a watcher set
// that a unit test would have to fake wholesale. What can be checked cheaply is
// the thing that was missing: that the dial and the release are wired together
// in one place rather than at five call sites, four of which forgot.
