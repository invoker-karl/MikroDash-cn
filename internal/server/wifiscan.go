// takes the chosen radio off the air and drops every client on it. Everything
// here is shaped by that — two independent permission gates, an audit record
// written BEFORE the command is sent, and a runner that bounds the damage.

// null when the failure happened before a scan existed, so the page never has to
// distinguish a missing key from a null one.
