// `POST /api/routers/{id}/activate` — promote a router to the install-wide
// default.
//
// ── THIS IS THE LAST THING BETWEEN THE FIRST-RUN OVERLAY AND BEING USABLE ──
//
// `web/src/pages/setup-overlay-wire.ts` is complete and gated and deliberately
// unmounted, for one reason: its Connect button adds a router and then activates
// it, and this route was a 404. A first run would have ended with a router in
// the file that nothing had selected.
//
// ── "ALREADY ACTIVE" IS A SUCCESS, NOT A NO-OP TO BE TIDIED AWAY ───────────
//
// The live route answers `{ok:true, alreadyActive:true}` and does nothing else:
// no switch, no audit row, no broadcast. That matters because the overlay and
// the router picker both call this, and re-activating the current router must
// not tear down every session to arrive back where it started.
//
// ── AND THE ANSWER GOES OUT BEFORE THE SWITCH ─────────────────────────────
//
// The live comment: "respond before the async switch". Tearing down sessions and
// building new ones takes seconds against a real router; a client left waiting
// on the response would time out and report a failure for a switch that
// succeeded. So the reply is `{ok:true, switching:true}` — which the overlay
// treats as success, and which is why `if (!d.ok && !d.switching)` is the guard
// there rather than `if (!d.ok)`.

//
// This was extracted from the DELETE route's promote-a-survivor path, and the
// first extraction moved every connection whose router was not the target —
// which is a DIFFERENT and much wider move. Those two callers ask related but
// distinct questions:
//
//	DELETE    move the sockets that were on the router just removed
//	ACTIVATE  move the sockets that were following the OLD DEFAULT
//
// and neither means "everyone not already here". A session pinned to a third
// router by `router:switch` matches that wider test and must not move: the live
// comment on the activate route says a global emit "would wrongly flip their
// selector to a router whose data they aren't receiving", and dragging their
// rooms across does worse — it changes what they receive.
//
// The de-duplication was still worth doing; the parameter is what makes it
// honest. Two copies of "which rooms does this connection leave" is one prefix
// away from a socket still receiving a router it is no longer looking at.
