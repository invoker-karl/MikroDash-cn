// ── WHAT IS AND IS NOT SWITCHED ON HERE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// This wires the EVALUATOR and the DATABASE WRITES. It does not dispatch: no
// Telegram message, no email, no ntfy push. `internal/alertwire` has no code
// that could, and that is deliberate — cutover blocker 5 is the one
// blocker whose reasoning did not change when the port went standalone:
//
//	Both engines evaluate the same conditions against the same physical
//	routers, and the cooldown is an in-memory map rather than a shared row, so
//	neither sees the other's sends. A duplicated Telegram message or email
//	cannot be un-received.
//
// A row filed twice is a duplicate an operator can delete. A message sent twice
// is not. So the writes go in now — they are what make the Alerts page and the
// Devices alert counts real — and the sending waits for the operator's call.
//
// ── NIL WITHOUT A DATABASE, AND NIL IS INERT ───────────────────────────────
//
// `Wire.Evaluate` guards on its receiver, so an install with no `/data` history
// serves every page and files nothing, rather than failing to start.

	// every startup. `CLAUDE.md` recorded that contradiction going unread for
	// days; it was still printing it at cutover on 2026-08-30, because
	// `TestTheDispatchBannerMatchesTheWiring` only ever checked the OTHER half.
