// The API Diagnostics card's feed.
//
// ── IT COSTS THE ROUTER NOTHING, WHICH IS THE REQUIREMENT ──────────────────
//
// `session.Diagnostics` reads counters this process already keeps: the command
// rate, the cache's subscription set, the collector table and the hub's room
// occupancy. No RouterOS command is issued to build this payload, so watching
// the card cannot change what it is measuring.
//
// ── THE CARD NEVER WORKED IN THIS PORT ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The renderer, the listener and the room have all existed since the port, and
// nothing ever emitted `diagnostics:update` — `internal/verify/event_test.go`
// recorded it as a deliberate gap: "there is no diagnostics collector... The card
// renders empty." That was honest and it was also the whole bug: a card that
// renders empty looks identical to a card with nothing to say.
//
// ── AND IT IS NOT A COLLECTOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It reports on THIS PROCESS, not on the router, so it has no menu, no cadence
// of its own to negotiate and nothing to put in `internal/collect`. It is a view
// over state, driven by a ticker that runs only while somebody is looking at it.
