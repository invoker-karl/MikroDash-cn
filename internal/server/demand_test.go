//
// Demand's rule is "a collector runs if anybody is in any room it declares". A
// collector no room can want is therefore never wanted by a viewer — it can only
// run for alerting or a hold, and on a router with neither it is suspended from
// connect to teardown with nothing anywhere saying so.
//
// Under the switchboard that could not happen: a page's case called
// `ResumeCollector` by name whether or not the collector's rooms agreed. So this
// hazard is CREATED by demand, which is why it is a gate rather than a comment.
//
// ── THERE IS NO EXEMPTION LIST, AND THERE WAS ──────────────────────────────
//
// `roomlessCollectors` was a map recording which collectors were allowed to have
// no rooms and why. It held one entry, `dhcpLeases`, and THAT ENTRY WAS WRONG —
// it emits router-wide, so the DHCP and Connections pages render it directly and
// suspending it blanks both. The map was then kept EMPTY, with a comment saying
// the next collector with no audience would need somewhere to say so.
//
// Phase 6.1 deleted it. A collector with no demand rooms has `keepAliveFor` to
// name the rooms that should keep it alive — which is what `arp` and `dhcpLeases`
// both use — and an empty exemption list is a mechanism with no instances kept
// against a hypothetical caller. If one ever genuinely needs an exemption, the
// map is four lines and git history has this paragraph.

// ── A MIGRATION CHECK THAT OUTLIVED ITS SUBJECT, DELIBERATELY ──────────────
//
// It was written before the switchover and read `ws.go` directly: scan the
// `ResumeCollector("…")` literals, and assert every collector the switchboard
// could start is one the demand rule can also start. Converting a page must not
// silently drop a collector.
//
// The switchboard is gone, so the scan now finds nothing and the check would
// pass by reading an empty set — the failure mode this repository has lost
// coverage to before. The list is therefore FROZEN here, as it stood at
// 8ffc8a4, and the assertion is unchanged: every collector the switchboard could
// start must still be gatable by demand today.
//
// That keeps meaning something after the deletion. A collector that loses its
// entry from `session.TargetKeys()` — or is renamed without the table following
// — was reachable by the shipped app and is no longer reachable by anything, and
// this is what says so.
