// `/healthz` answered 503 for an install with no device configured, because

// simply `connected`. Not just during the grace window — after 90 seconds it was
// not even reported as `starting`, just unhealthy, for ever.
//
// THAT DEADLOCKS THE ROUTEROS APP INSTALL, which is a documented path
// (`docs/routeros-container-install.md`). The App withholds its UI-URL until the
// container is healthy; the container is unhealthy until a device is added; and
// a device can only be added through the UI. Reported on issue #120 by an
// operator who had to find the address by hand to get in at all.
//
// THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME THIS CLASS HAS SHIPPED — "a thing that does not exist
// yet, reported as a failure". 0.8.11 was a missing `.secret`, 0.8.12 a missing
// `users.json` read as an error rather than "no users yet", 0.8.14 a first run
// with no wizard, 0.8.16 a missing `settings.json`.
// `TestEveryConfigReaderSurvivesAFreshInstall` was written to stop a fourth and
// could not see this one: it guards config READERS, and this is the same mistake
// one layer up, in what the reading MEANS.
//
// The distinction being drawn is between three states, not two. Nothing to
// connect to is healthy; something to connect to that has not answered yet is
// starting; something that should be there and is not is unhealthy. Only the
// first changes here.

// rather than noise about a non-fault.
//
// TRUNCATED JSON, not a boolean held as a string. The obvious fixture for this
// is `"disabled": "false"`, and it does not work: `store.Routers` retries
// through `normalizeStoredRouterBools` and repairs its own copy, so that file
// yields a router plus a warning and this test would pass whatever
// `deviceExpected` did. Found by mutating the fix and watching this test survive
