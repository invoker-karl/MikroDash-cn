// THE SESSION MANAGER'S IDENTITY WRITER IS ATTACHED, BEFORE THE FIRST SESSION.
//
// A nil writer is silently inert by design — it is nil in every test — so
// deleting the one line in `New` would bring back the defect it fixed: Settings
// → Devices showing each router's RouterOS version from before its last
// upgrade, with a green suite.
//
// ── AND ITS POSITION IS PART OF THE CLAIM ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A session takes the writer when it is BUILT, and `syncFleetHolds` builds a
// held session for the fleet. The first version of this fix attached the writer
// forty lines after the first sync, beside the alert sink: every held router
// captured nil, the unit tests (which attach first) passed, and the live
// install went on showing `7.24`. The history recorder's comment in `New` names
// the same trap. So the attachment must come before the first sync, and this
// fails if it does not.
