// THE ALERT CALLER — live's `alerter.js` fan-out, and the piece that was missing.
//
// ── WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE THIS FILE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Evaluate()` returns `[]Fired` and BOTH call sites discarded it, while
// `srv.dispatch` was assigned in `New` and never read. So every alert was
// recorded and none was ever sent, for as long as `-alert-dispatch` has
// existed — while the flag's own startup line promised the opposite. LOOP.md 0k.
//
// ── THE ORDER OF THE GUARDS IS LIVE'S ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// `_deliver`'s comment states it: "no usable channel, then the alert-type
// toggles, then the cooldown — and the cooldown is consumed only where a send
// actually happens, so a recipient who enables a channel later does not find a
// warm cooldown stamped while they had none."
//
// `Dispatcher.Deliver` already owns the last two. This file owns the first, in
// `perUserRecipients`, because a recipient with no channel must never reach the
// cooldown at all.

// dispatchFired sends every alert one evaluation produced.
//
// NON-BLOCKING FOR THE COLLECTOR that produced the payload: delivery talks to
// Telegram, SMTP and ntfy over the network, and this runs on the emit path of a
// collector tick. Live's sends are promises nobody awaits, for the same reason.

// dispatchBackup sends one backup notification: a drift or a failure.
//
// ── WHY IT IS NOT AN ALERT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It goes out through the same recipients, settings and cooldown as an alert,
// but it is not one and does not pretend to be. `alert.Fired` carries a rule, a
// direction and a subject that the Alerts page renders and the database records;
// a backup result has none of those. Building a synthetic Fired to reuse
// `dispatchFired` would put rows on the Alerts page for something that is not an
// alert, which is worse than two short functions.
//
// The COOLDOWN KEY is per router and kind, so a router failing every night is
// rate-limited like anything else, and a drift on one router never suppresses a
// failure on another.
//
// Non-blocking, for the reason `dispatchFired` gives: this runs on the backup
// path, and delivery talks to Telegram, SMTP and ntfy over the network.
func (s *Server) dispatchBackup(routerID, kind, title, body string) {
	if s.dispatch == nil || !s.dispatch.Enabled() || title == "" {

	}
	recipients := s.dispatch.Recipients(routerID, s.perUserRecipients)
	if len(recipients) == 0 {
		return
	}
	msg := alertdispatch.Message{Title: title, Body: body}
	key := "backup:" + kind + ":" + routerID

	go func() {
		ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
		defer cancel()
		for i := range recipients {
			// Per recipient, result ignored: `Deliver` logs its own failure, and

			s.dispatch.Deliver(ctx, &recipients[i], key, msg)

// cooldownKey is the per-alert cooldown bucket.
//
// ── AN APPROXIMATION OF LIVE'S KEY, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NAMED ───────────
//
// Live passes the key as `fire()`'s first argument — `iface:ether1:down`,
// `netwatch:*7:up`, `cpu:router:down` — so it is chosen per rule and does not
// travel on the fired alert. `alert.Fired` does not carry it, and adding it
// would mean retyping twenty rule-specific strings into the gated evaluator
// with nothing to check them against, which is the "retyped table" mistake this
// project keeps finding.
//
// So it is derived from what `Fired` does carry: stored type, subject and
// direction. The STRINGS differ from live's — `routeros_update::down` against
// `update:router:down` — and that is harmless, because the key is an internal
// cooldown bucket that is never shown to anyone.
//
// ── AND THE DERIVATION IS VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED ───────────────────────────
//
// The alert-eval corpus now captures the key live actually delivered with,
// and `TestTheDerivedCooldownKeysPartitionLikeLive` compares the two schemes on
// the property that matters: which alerts share a bucket.
// **250,042 pairs across 113 cases, zero disagreements** — including netwatch,
// where live keys on the host's RouterOS `.id` and this keys on its name.
//
// The one case the corpus cannot speak for is two netwatch entries sharing a
// NAME: live would still separate them by id and this would not, so the second
// one's notification could be suppressed inside the cooldown window. That is the
// entire remaining difference, and it is narrower than "the key is derived".
func cooldownKey(f alert.Fired) string {
	stored := alert.StoredType(f.AlertType)
	if f.Up && f.ResolveType != "" {
		stored = f.ResolveType
	}
	dir := "down"
	if f.Up {
		dir = "up"
	}
	return stored + ":" + f.Subject + ":" + dir
}

// alertTimestamp is live's `_ts()` — the wall clock in the install's display
// zone, or the server's own when none is set.

// perUserRecipients is live's `userNotify.recipientsFor`.
//
// ── AUTHORISATION IS ASKED AT SEND TIME, NEVER CACHED ─────────────────────
//
// The live comment is explicit: "recipientsFor() therefore asks Rbac.can(...,
// 'router:read', routerId) at SEND time, not at subscribe time, so revoking a
// grant stops delivery on the very next alert with nothing to invalidate." A
// reverse "which users hold a grant covering this router" query would be faster
// and would be a second answer to the same question.
//
// A USER WITH NO CHANNEL IS SKIPPED BEFORE THE PERMISSION CHECK, matching
// `_hasChannel` first in the live order — there is no point asking whether
// somebody may receive something that has nowhere to go.
