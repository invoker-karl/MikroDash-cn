// Constructing the background pool — the caller `internal/routers` was written
// without.
//
// ── WHAT WAS BLOCKING IT, AND WHAT LIFTED ───────────────────────────────────
//
// cutover item 2: the Devices page's rows need numbers for routers
// nobody has open, and Node runs the same pool against the same fleet. Two pools
// mean two connections to every router at once, and the documented bottleneck on
// a MikroTik is concurrent API channels, not CPU (`../MikroDash/src/collection.js:8`).
// So the code was written, pinned and constructed by NOBODY, pending the
// operator's call.
//
// The operator's instruction on 2026-08-28: "port whatever is still missing now.
// This app can now run independently so we can compare it to the live version
// side by side. It should run on its own with no dependencies on the live
// environment." A Devices page with no rows is a dependency on the live
// environment, so the pool runs.
//
// ── IT IS BOUND TO `standalone`, NOT TO A NEW FLAG ──────────────────────────
//
// The reason a Go pool must not run is that a NODE pool is running, and a Node
// pool running is exactly what `-node` configures. Binding to it means the rule
// cannot be set wrong in one place and right in the other — the same argument
// `standalone` itself is derived by, a few lines up in `New`.
//
// **What that binding does NOT cover, stated because it is currently true:** the
// operator is running this process standalone WHILE the live app is also up, on
// its own copy of /data, precisely to compare them. Both pools are therefore
// live against the same three physical routers, and each router carries three
// extra channels for as long as somebody has the Devices page open. That is a
// real cost the flag below exists to drop, and it is bounded — the pool is
// SUSPENDED whenever nobody is looking at the page.
//
// ── THE POOL IS NOT STARTED HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `NewPool` connects to nothing; `Sync` does, and the only caller of `Sync` is
// `devicesFocus`, which fires when a browser opens the page. Construction is
// therefore free, which is what makes binding it to a mode rather than a
// lifecycle honest.

// ── ALL THREE EFFECTS ARE GATED ON THE WRITE ────────────────────────────────

// A router reports the same identity on every poll. `UpdateIdentity` answering
// false is the common case by a wide margin, and it is what stops this from
// rewriting routers.json, emitting an audit event and waking every browser
// several times a minute. A port that ungated any one of the three would look
// correct and behave like a leak.
//
// ── AND IT SWALLOWS ITS ERRORS, LIKE THE ORIGINAL ───────────────────────────

// router said about itself must not take down the session that is otherwise
// collecting fine — the identity will be offered again on the next poll.
