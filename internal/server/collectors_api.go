// `GET /api/collectors` — the per-router collector toggles the Add/Edit Device
// dialog offers.
//
// ── WHY THIS ONE CAN BE SERVED NOW ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It was on `endpoint-audit`'s proxied list with a precise cost: without it "the
// dialog offers an EMPTY list rather than an error, so the operator sees a router
// with no collectors to choose from and no way to tell that is wrong."
//
// It became servable when #105 landed. The live route is three lines over the
// SAME registry this port now embeds (`_COLLECTOR_DEFS` is `collection.js`'s
// `COLLECTORS` under an alias), so answering it here is a projection of generated
// data rather than a second source of truth.
//
// ── ONLY THE DISABLEABLE ONES, AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT ─────────────────────
//
// The dialog draws a checkbox per entry, so a protected collector appearing here
// would offer an operator a switch that does nothing — `resolveCollection` forces
// `enabled` true for anything `disableable: false` regardless of the off list.
// The live route filters, and so does this.
//
// `requires` rides along because the dialog uses it to cascade: unticking a
// collector others depend on must visibly untick them too.
