// The write path: res:save and res:remove.
//
// THE ORDER OF THE CHECKS IS THE SAFETY ARGUMENT, and it is preserved from
// src/index.js rather than rearranged for readability:
//
//	permission → validate → READ THE MENU FRESH → find the row → is it still
//	the row the operator saw → may this row be edited at all → write
//
// The row is ADDRESSED by the `.id` the browser sends and AUTHORISED by nothing
// the browser sends. Both the staleness check and the read-only check run
// against the row as the router has it right now, never against the browser's
// claim about it — which is why the read happens before them and not once at
// page load.
//
// TWO GAPS, BOTH CUTOVER BLOCKERS, BOTH RECORDED RATHER THAN QUIETLY ACCEPTED:
//
//  1. PERMISSION IS COARSER THAN NODE'S. Node requires page-write AND
//     `router:write` for this router. `/api/auth/status` exposes neither
//     per-router page access nor router:write — see the long note in auth.go —
//     so this checks page-write unioned across readable routers, intersected
//     with "may read this router". Exact wherever a principal's access does not
//     vary between routers; over-permissive where it does.
//
//  2. Writes and denials ARE recorded now, in the same audit_events table Node
//     writes to — see internal/db for why a second writer is safe here and why
//     this side never migrates. Secrets are masked by FIELD TYPE before anything
//     is diffed (auditValues, in audit.go): a resource field is named for the
//     form, so `wpa2PreSharedKey` matches no credential name pattern, and the
//     type declaration is what actually keeps a passphrase out of the trail.
