// #105: EVERY PAGE-FOCUS RESUME IS GATED.
//
// The connect path was gated first and this one was missed, which is the shape
// of the bug worth pinning: a collector the operator turned off stayed off until
// somebody opened its page, and then came back. Half a feature is worse than
// none here, because the router silently starts answering again.
//
// ── THE GUARD MOVED INTO THE FUNNEL (2026-08-28), AND THE CALLER MOVED
//
//	OUT OF THIS FILE (2026-09-10) ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It began as `if CollectorEnabled("k") { X().Resume() }` at twenty page cases,
// each repeating the check. Those became `cn.rsession.ResumeCollector("k")` —
// the live `_resumeCollector`, ONE place that checks enabled and consults the
// dormancy veto, so "a gate that knows nothing about dormancy cannot undo it".
//
// Phase 4.2b deleted the twenty call sites. `applyDemand` in demand.go decides
// what runs, from the room declarations, and it calls the same funnel. So the
// LIST half of this test is gone — a page no longer names its collectors, and
// `demand_test.go` holds the frozen record of what the switchboard used to
// resume plus the gate that every collector is still reachable.
//
// WHAT SURVIVES IS THE REGRESSION CHECK, and it is the half that was worth
// having: no bare `X().Resume()` anywhere in this package. That is a resume
// which skips both the enabled check and the veto, and the second is the one the
// live app warns about — it "would wake a dormant collector on the next socket
// join". A direct call is EASIER to reach for now than it was under the
// switchboard, because there is no longer an obvious per-page place to add one
// properly.
