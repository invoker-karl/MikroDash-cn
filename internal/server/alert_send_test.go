// THE DERIVED COOLDOWN KEYS PARTITION ALERTS EXACTLY AS LIVE'S DO.
//
// ── STRING EQUALITY IS THE WRONG TEST, AND THE FIRST VERSION USED IT ──────
//
// Live's keys are `update:router:down`, `netwatch:1:down`, `bgp:k1:down`; the
// port derives `routeros_update::down`, `host_down:10.0.0.1:down`. All 1,091
// differ as strings, and every one of those differences is harmless: the key is
// an internal cooldown bucket, never shown to anyone.
//
// What a cooldown key DOES is decide which notification suppresses which. Two
// alerts sharing a key share a cooldown. So the property worth testing is that
// the two schemes induce the SAME PARTITION — same alerts grouped, same alerts
// separated — not that they spell the groups the same way.
//
// ── HOW THE KEYS GOT HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Live's key is `fire()`'s first argument and never travels on the fired alert.
// The alert-eval corpus now captures it from its `_deliver` stub, which is
// what makes this checkable at all.
//
// Recording them immediately found a defect: the update-supersede case EMITS
// three alerts and DELIVERS two, because live's supersede resolution goes
// through `_emit` and never reaches the delivery loop. `Fired.Silent` exists
// because of this corpus, and without it the port would have sent an extra "up"
// notification on every version change.
