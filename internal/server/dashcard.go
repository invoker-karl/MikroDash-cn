// Dashboard card rooms.
//
// A card on the Dashboard can be the ONLY view a collector gets. Someone whose
// dashboard shows the Firewall card but who never opens the Firewall page still
// needs that collector running, so a card joins a room of its own and wakes the
// same collectors the page would.
//
// ── TWO PAGES ARE CHECKED, NOT ONE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A card needs the DASHBOARD and the page it borrows its data from. Streaming
// firewall detail through a dashboard card to someone denied the Firewall page
// would make the whole permission matrix a lie — and it is the first thing an
// operator checks. Both are required before the room is joined, and the join and
// the replay are gated together: gating only the join would still hand the
// caller a payload they may not see.
//
// ── THE KEY IS VALIDATED, NOT ESCAPED ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// It becomes part of a room name, and room names are how payloads are addressed.
// A key outside `[a-z]{2,20}` is refused outright rather than sanitised, because
// there is no such thing as a card whose name needed cleaning up.

// the collector with this key, else dashboard". Seven of the eight rooms the
// grid can ask for ARE page keys and resolve to themselves; `diagnostics` is
// neither a page nor a collector and falls back to `dashboard`.
//
// Written as an explicit map rather than a lookup through a page registry this
// port does not have, and checked against the live resolution by
// The grid table generator — so a room added over there fails here rather than
// silently resolving to `dashboard` and being gated on the wrong page.

// dashCardRooms maps a card's room KEY to the room its collector actually emits
// to, where the two differ.
//
// ── TWO KEYS DO NOT NAME THEIR OWN ROOM ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `CARD_ROOMS` (lifted verbatim from live's `dashboard-grid.js`) gives
// `dc-card-physports` the key `interfaces` and `card-network` the key `dhcp`,
// while the collectors emit to `dash-card-physports` and `dash-card-network`.
// Joining `dash-card-` + key therefore subscribes a browser to a room NOTHING
// EVER SENDS TO, for both cards.
//
// Live has the identical mismatch and gets away with it: its cards are painted
// by the connect-time replay in `sendInitialState`, and its router session is
// long-lived so a payload is already waiting. This port creates the session when
// a browser selects a router, so the replay races the collector's first tick —
// `ifStatus` polls every 5s and usually wins, `dhcpNetworks` polls every 600s and
// does not. That is the whole difference between Physical Ports looking fine and
// Network showing an em dash.
//
// Aliasing the JOIN is the smallest change that makes both correct: the emitted
// rooms stay exactly live's (so `emit-rooms-audit` still passes), the blur guards
// in ws.go already name `dash-card-network`, and the cards now receive ONGOING
// updates rather than one replay they might have missed.
//
// `TestEveryCardRoomIsEmittedTo` pins the property this table exists to hold.

	// cards — Connections, Network, Physical Ports — never received their

	// the identical frames AFTER a select delivers all three.
