//     server's own configuration against the router adds no safety.
//
//  2. AT ATTACH TIME THERE IS NOTHING TO VALIDATE AGAINST. `trafficSelect` feeds
//     `SetAvailable` from `IfStatus().Last()`, and on a fresh attach the status
//     collector has not produced a reading yet — so `NormalizeIfName` refuses,
//     the function returns early, and no room is joined. That is exactly what

// SUPERSET of what the live app does — which is the right direction, fewer
// channels held, and is why the live app never had this bug.
//

// blur; a `dash-card-*` room emptying is not, so it must be TESTED rather than
// assumed. `nil` is a collector this session does not have.
