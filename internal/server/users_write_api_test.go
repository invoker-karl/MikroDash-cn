// The three ADMINISTRATION routes for user accounts.
//
// ── WHAT IS WORTH TESTING HERE AND WHAT IS NOT ─────────────────────────────
//
// The store writers beneath these are already pinned against the live functions
// by the userwrite corpus and `internal/store/users_update_test.go` — 22
// update cases, 3 delete cases, 13 mutations. What those cannot see is the
// HTTP layer's own decisions, and every one of them is a rule whose failure is
// SILENT:
//
//   - the conditional grant projection. `syncUserGrants` deletes every grant the
//     principal holds and rebuilds them, so running it on a RENAME would destroy
//     an administrator's work with a 200 and no message.
//   - the orphan probes. Both the delete route and the legacy `role` field can
//     leave an install with nobody able to administer it.
//   - the cascade. `user_notify_config` holds ENCRYPTED CHANNEL CREDENTIALS, so
//     a row outliving its account means a reused id inherits somebody's Telegram
//     token.
//
// Those are what this file is for.

// usersWriteServer reuses `usersServer`'s harness and adds the write routes.
// usersWriteDDL is what the CASCADE needs and the read fixture does not have.
//
// `usersGrantsDDL` was written for `GET /api/users`, which joins grants and
// nothing else. The delete route clears three tables, and two of them were
// simply absent — which surfaced as "no such table: user_layouts" rather than as
// a wrong answer, because SQLite has no opinion about a DELETE on a table that
// does not exist until you run one.
//
// `group_members` is here for `WouldOrphanGlobalAdmin`, which reads it: an
// administrator whose grant is held THROUGH A GROUP is exactly the case the
// probe exists to see, and a fixture without the table cannot express it.

-- A BUILTIN role at global scope, held by u-1. globalAdminQuery counts only
-- builtin = 1 roles -- "a custom role may confer everything today and be edited
-- to confer nothing tomorrow" -- so a fixture whose roles are all custom has ZERO
-- administrators, and WouldOrphanGlobalAdmin then refuses EVERY delete. That is
-- faithful behaviour answering a question the fixture asked wrong.
-- (No backticks in this comment: it sits inside a Go raw string. Putting a pair
-- around a query name here is what broke the build on the first attempt.)
-- THE IDS THE PROJECTION ACTUALLY WRITES, which are not the role NAMES.
-- legacyRoleIDs maps admin->administrator, operator->operator, viewer->readonly,
-- and resolveRoleID falls back to 'readonly' for anything else. A fixture whose
-- roles table is keyed by the names instead fails the foreign key on every
-- projection -- which is a logged error and a 200, so the grants simply never
-- appear and the test reads as "nothing was projected".
-- DISTINCT NAMES. The first version named the readonly role 'viewer', which
-- collides with usersGrantsDDL's own 'viewer' role -- harmless until
-- rolesWriteDDL declared the UNIQUE index that the real schema has, at which
-- point the index could not be created at all and every role test failed on the
-- constraint rather than on what it was testing. The ids are what
-- legacyRoleIDs maps onto; the names are free.
INSERT INTO roles (id, name, builtin) VALUES

-- the custom role 'auditor'), and the unique index above is exactly what stops a
-- second row at the same scope -- so an INSERT here fails the constraint it was
-- added to declare. Isolated to this harness: the read tests build their own
-- database and never run this DDL.

//
// ── WHY THE PROBE MUST RUN THE PROJECTION, NOT A DELETE ────────────────────
//
// `syncUserGrants` deletes every grant the principal holds and then REBUILDS
// them, so whether administration survives depends on what the rebuild puts
// back. Probing a bare delete instead is strictly harsher: it refuses whenever
// the subject is the last administrator, including when the edit was about to
// restore exactly the grant it removed.
//
// The case that separates them is the ordinary one: the last administrator's
// record is re-saved with `role: "admin"`. The projection deletes the admin
// grant and immediately writes it back, so nobody is orphaned and the edit must
// succeed. A delete-probe answers "that would leave nobody with administrator
// access" — to somebody who was not changing anything.
//
// Found by mutation: swapping the projection probe for a delete probe survived
// the suite until this existed.
