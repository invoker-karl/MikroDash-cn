// `GET /healthz` — the port of `src/health.js` plus its route.

// ── IT WAS MISSING, AND TWO THINGS DEPENDED ON IT ─────────────────────────
//
//	the container   `docker-compose.yml` runs
//	                `wget -qO- http://127.0.0.1:3081/healthz` as its HEALTHCHECK.
//	                A port that 404s here comes up permanently unhealthy.
//	the app itself  `web/src/pages/settings.ts` and `web/src/account.ts` both
//	                fetch it for the version string. Those were failing silently
//	                — each guards on `d.version`, so a 404 shows a blank instead
//	                of an error.

// Found on 2026-08-29 by listing live's modules and asking which have no port
// equivalent. The endpoint audit could not have found it twice over: it
// only looked at `/api` paths, and its wildcard matcher treated Go's `{$}`
// end-of-path anchor as a segment wildcard, so `/{$}` "served" every
// single-segment path. Both are fixed.

// honest; inventing a `stale` array that is always empty would look like the
// third check passing.

// ── SET TO MATCH THE LIVE APP, ON THE OPERATOR'S INSTRUCTION (2026-08-29) ──
//
// Reported as `version` on /healthz; `web/src/pages/settings.ts` and
// `web/src/account.ts` render `'v' + d.version`, so this is the bare number with
// no `v`.
//
// It is a CONSTANT rather than read from a file. The Node app read it from
// package.json, which no longer exists, and inventing a file to hold one number
// would add a build input for nothing. CLAUDE.md's rule still applies: a bump
// happens only when the operator says package it up, and one bump covers the
// whole session.
//
// 0.8.0 was the cutover release — the first on Go and TypeScript — but it never
// produced an image: its build failed on the newly restored 32-bit ARM target.
// 0.8.1 is that same cutover with the 32-bit fix, and was the first published
// Go image. 0.7.40 was the last on Node.
//
// 0.8.10 SORTS AFTER 0.8.2, and the jump is deliberate rather than a typo: these
// are numbers, not decimals, so ten follows two. Docker tags are strings and
// sort lexically, which is why the next one is 0.8.11 and not 0.8.3.
//
// 0.8.11 is the first release a NEW install can complete at all: until it, a
// fresh /data had no `.secret` (so the process exited before serving a page) and
// no database (so the first administrator held no grants). See issue #124.
//
// 0.8.12 finishes that job. 0.8.11 created the files and STILL could not be set
// up: a missing users.json was reported as a read error rather than as "no users
// yet", so `firstRun` never went true and the login page offered a Sign In form
// for an account that could not exist. Same issue, one layer up.
//
// 0.8.13 is the LAST step of that same walk, found by the same reporter getting
// one screen further each time: the wizard worked, and then Add Device did
// nothing, because `#rtrAddBtn` had no listener bound to it anywhere. A new
// install could create its administrator and still not add a router. Three
// releases to make a first run work end to end is worth remembering when the
// next port lands.
//
// 0.8.14 is the one after that, and it stops the walk: a new install now lands
// on the router wizard instead of an empty dashboard. The overlay had existed
// all along and was shown on ONE trigger — the last router being deleted — so it
// could never appear on a first run, which is the only case it is for.
//
// 0.8.15 is the one where the Settings page can save. `#settingsSaveBtn` was
// bound to nothing at all, so no server-side setting could be written from any
// tab — the third control found unwired in a week, after the Add Device button
// and the first-run wizard. `TestInteractiveControlsAreBoundBeyondCaps` is the
// gate that would have caught all three.
//
// 0.8.16 fixes the THIRD instance of one class in a week: a config file that
// does not exist yet reported as a failure. users.json in 0.8.12, routers.json
// in 0.8.14, settings.json here — where it stopped a clean install activating
// its first router. `readIfPresent` is the rule in one place, and
// `TestEveryConfigReaderSurvivesAFreshInstall` is what stops a fourth.
//
// ONE DEFINITION. Anything else needing the app version reads this.

// activeRouterHealth reports whether the router this install is pointed at is
// reachable, and which one that is.
//
// It asks the INTERACTIVE session first and the always-on pool second, because
// those are the two things that hold a connection — and after `internal/alertpool`
// landed, a router nobody is watching is genuinely connected rather than merely
// unknown. Before that this would have read "down" for the whole fleet whenever
// nobody had a browser open, which is exactly the wrong answer for a healthcheck.
