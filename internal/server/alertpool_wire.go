// The always-on pool's wiring — the port of `_syncAlertSessions`.
//
// ── WHAT WAS MISSING, AND WHY IT WAS NOT OBVIOUS ───────────────────────────
//
// The live app runs TWO background pools and this port had ported one.
// `internal/routers.Pool` is `overviewSessions`, gated on the Devices page, and
// that gating is faithful. `alertSessions` is the other, and it is ALWAYS ON:
// one session per non-disabled, non-active router, whatever anyone is looking
// at. Its absence cost two things:
//
//	alerts    `alertwire.Evaluate` is reached from ONE place — the emit closure
//	          in session.go — so with `-alert-dispatch` on, alerts fired only for
//	          the router on screen. An operator would believe the fleet covered.
//	status    non-active routers read Offline until the Devices page was opened,
//	          which is how the operator noticed on 2026-08-29.
//
// ── IT SHARES `-no-pool` WITH THE OVERVIEW POOL, DELIBERATELY ──────────────
//
// Live gates the two separately, because one is bound to a page and the other is
// not. Here they share a switch because the switch means one thing — "do not
// hold background connections to routers nobody is watching" — and somebody
// passing it wants exactly that from both. Documented rather than assumed; if
// finer control is ever needed, splitting the flag is a small change and this
// comment is where to start.

	// immediately after it, so excluding on existence tore down a live, connected

	// consequences, and the second is the worse one:
	//
	//  1. The Devices page lost the only source that could answer for those
	//     routers, so they showed as not-yet-known for the ~2s the overview pool
	//     took to connect — measured on this install, cold open, 130ms to
	//     2150ms. Before `Known` existed they showed as OFFLINE, in red, which
	//     is the defect the operator reported twice.
	//  2. A COVERAGE GAP: for those two seconds the router was held by NEITHER
	//     pool, so nothing was evaluating its alerts. That is the same hole the
	//     `activeID` note in syncAlertPool exists to avoid, reached from the
	//     other direction.
	//
	// The overlap this costs is bounded and short. `Known` goes true on the first
	// connect AND on the first error, so a router that is genuinely down is
	// excluded as soon as the overview pool finds that out, rather than being
	// held by both for ever.

	//    DIVERGENCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

	// `_syncAlertSessions` passes `activeRouterId` and skips it, because the live
	// app ALWAYS holds a session for the active router — `_routerSessions` has
	// one whether or not a browser is open, so excluding it costs nothing.
	//
	// THIS PORT HAS NO SUCH SESSION. `session.Manager.Acquire` is ref-counted:
	// the session exists while somebody is looking and is torn down when the last
	// viewer leaves. Excluding the active router by id therefore leaves it
	// covered by NOTHING the moment the last browser closes — no status, no alert
	// evaluation, on the one router the install is pointed at.
	//
	// Measured 2026-08-29: with no browser open, `/healthz` reported the active
	// router down because neither the session nor the pool held it.
	//
	// So the exclusion is by LIVE SESSION rather than by id, below. The behaviour
	// is live's — every router is always covered — and the mechanism differs
	// because the mechanism it relied on is not here. `PlanSync` still takes an
	// activeID and still honours it; passing "" is this caller's decision, and

	// opposite of what is wanted — it is the router that most needs covering

	//
	// History used to need the actual id here, because ONE router recorded and
	// it was the active one. Conflating the two values with the constant above
	// set the recorded router to "none": measured, four minutes with no browser
	// produced zero rows while the pool was connected to all three routers.
	//
	// That whole question is gone. Recording is each router's own
	// `ReportingEnabled`, carried in the projection above, and `PlanSync`
	// rebuilds a session whose flag changed. `activeID` is still the constant.
	// ── PHASE 4.3d: HOLD A SESSION FOR THE ROUTERS THAT NEED ONE ──────────
	//
	// A `session.Session` already feeds the alert evaluator and the history
	// recorder, at one seam in its emit closure. The only reason this pool
	// exists is that a Session dies when its last viewer leaves — so a router
	// that needs alerting or recording is held instead, and `alertPoolExclusions`
	// then drops it from the pool WITHOUT A NEW RULE, because it already excludes
	// every router with a live session.
	//
	// A held session runs the six collectors alerting reads, not the fifteen a
	// viewer gets: see `session.Needs`. The pool ran seven for the same job.
	//
	// BEFORE `Sync`, so the exclusion set the pool is handed already reflects the
	// holds taken here. Taking them after would leave one sync's worth of both
	// holding the same router — which is the duplicate-evaluation bug that filed
