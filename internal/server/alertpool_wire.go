// The always-on pool's wiring — the port of `_syncAlertSessions`.
//
// ── WHAT WAS MISSING, AND WHY IT WAS NOT OBVIOUS ───────────────────────────
//
// The live app runs TWO background pools and this port had ported one.
// `internal/routers.Pool` is `overviewSessions`, gated on the Devices page, and
// that gating is faithful. `alertSessions` is the other, and it is ALWAYS ON:
// one session per non-disabled, non-active router, whatever anyone is looking
// at. Its absence cost two things:
//
//	alerts    `alertwire.Evaluate` is reached from ONE place — the emit closure
//	          in session.go — so with `-alert-dispatch` on, alerts fired only for
//	          the router on screen. An operator would believe the fleet covered.
//	status    non-active routers read Offline until the Devices page was opened,
//	          which is how the operator noticed on 2026-08-29.
//
// ── IT SHARES `-no-pool` WITH THE OVERVIEW POOL, DELIBERATELY ──────────────
//
// Live gates the two separately, because one is bound to a page and the other is
// not. Here they share a switch because the switch means one thing — "do not
// hold background connections to routers nobody is watching" — and somebody
// passing it wants exactly that from both. Documented rather than assumed; if
// finer control is ever needed, splitting the flag is a small change and this
// comment is where to start.

	// ── THE OVERVIEW POOL'S ROUTERS — ONCE IT HAS ANSWERED FOR THEM ─────────
	//
	// Excluded when the overview session has ANSWERED, not merely when it
	// exists. `syncPool` builds a session per router and `syncAlertPool` runs
	// immediately after it, so excluding on existence tore down a live, connected
	// alert session and handed the router to one that had not dialled yet. Two
	// consequences, and the second is the worse one:
	//
	//  1. The Devices page lost the only source that could answer for those
	//     routers, so they showed as not-yet-known for the ~2s the overview pool
	//     took to connect — measured on this install, cold open, 130ms to
	//     2150ms. Before `Known` existed they showed as OFFLINE, in red, which
	//     is the defect the operator reported twice.
	//  2. A COVERAGE GAP: for those two seconds the router was held by NEITHER
	//     pool, so nothing was evaluating its alerts. That is the same hole the
	//     `activeID` note in syncAlertPool exists to avoid, reached from the
	//     other direction.
	//
	// The overlap this costs is bounded and short. `Known` goes true on the first
	// connect AND on the first error, so a router that is genuinely down is
	// excluded as soon as the overview pool finds that out, rather than being
	// held by both for ever.

	// ── THE ACTIVE ROUTER IS *NOT* EXCLUDED HERE, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE
	//    DIVERGENCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// `_syncAlertSessions` passes `activeRouterId` and skips it, because the live
	// app ALWAYS holds a session for the active router — `_routerSessions` has
	// one whether or not a browser is open, so excluding it costs nothing.
	//
	// THIS PORT HAS NO SUCH SESSION. `session.Manager.Acquire` is ref-counted:
	// the session exists while somebody is looking and is torn down when the last
	// viewer leaves. Excluding the active router by id therefore leaves it
	// covered by NOTHING the moment the last browser closes — no status, no alert
	// evaluation, on the one router the install is pointed at.
	//
	// Measured 2026-08-29: with no browser open, `/healthz` reported the active
	// router down because neither the session nor the pool held it.
	//
	// So the exclusion is by LIVE SESSION rather than by id, below. The behaviour
	// is live's — every router is always covered — and the mechanism differs
	// because the mechanism it relied on is not here. `PlanSync` still takes an
	// activeID and still honours it; passing "" is this caller's decision, and
	// the rule stays tested for the day a persistent session exists.

	//
	// History needs the actual id, and reusing that constant set the recorded
