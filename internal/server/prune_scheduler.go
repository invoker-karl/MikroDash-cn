// THE DAILY RETENTION SWEEP'S CALLER — live's `startPruneInterval`.
//
// ── THE HALF THE DEFECT WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT ────────────────────────────────
//
// `db.Prune` without this is another setting that is read and thrown away, which
// is precisely the shape being fixed: `dbRetentionDays`, `dbAlertRetentionDays`
// and `dbAuditRetentionDays` were rendered, validated and persisted, and no code
// in the port ever consulted one. Writing the sweep and not starting it would
// leave that true while looking solved — the same trap `buildBackupScheduler`
// fell into, where a flag switched on a component that could not act.
//
// So the test for this file reads the START site, not the sweep.
//
// ── STANDALONE ONLY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// During coexistence the Node app runs `startPruneInterval` against the same
// database, and two sweeps would duplicate the work — harmlessly, since a DELETE
// by age is idempotent and the second finds nothing, but pointlessly. More to
// the point, retention is an INSTALL-wide policy and one process should own it.
// Standalone means there is no Node, so this process owns everything.
//
// ── THE SETTINGS ARE RE-READ ON EVERY SWEEP ───────────────────────────────
//
// Live's `run()` calls `getSettings()` each time rather than closing over a
// snapshot, so an operator who shortens retention sees it applied on the next
// sweep instead of the next restart. Reproduced: this reads the store per tick.
//
// That is a deliberate difference from `topN`, which the live app also reads
// from settings and deliberately does NOT re-read (see `Connections.WithTopN`).
// The two are not inconsistent — one is a collector's construction parameter,
// the other a policy the timer consults — and reproducing each as it is, is the
// port's contract.

// channel, both close it, and the second panics with "close of closed channel",
// which takes the process. `ps.stop` is also written unsynchronised, so it is a
// data race before it is a panic.
//
// One caller reaches it today — `Server.Shutdown` — so it was not reachable.
// That is an invariant of the CALLER, and this file already records what happens
// when this scheduler drifts from its sibling: the note in `server.go` explains
// that its `Stop` was once unreachable entirely while "the sibling two lines
// above was stopped correctly the whole time". Same asymmetry, second axis.
//
// `internal/backups`' `Scheduler.Stop` does its check-and-set under the
// scheduler mutex and says "Safe to call twice". This now matches it, so the
// guarantee belongs to Stop rather than to whoever calls it.
