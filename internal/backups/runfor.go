package backups

// One backup, recorded — the composition both the scheduler and the manual
// button go through.
//
// `Run` (run.go) has the conversation with the router. `PruneFor` (prunefor.go)
// applies retention. This is what joins them to the database, and it is the live
// `runFor` from src/backups/index.js.
//
// ── EVERY RUN GETS A ROW, WHATEVER HAPPENED ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Including the failures. A router that has failed nightly for a month should be
// able to show that from its own history, and a backup that silently does not
// happen is the failure mode this whole feature exists to prevent.
//
// ── ONLY A CHANGED RUN RECORDS A STEM ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `stem` and `dir` are the location of a stored pair. An unchanged run wrote no
// pair, so it has a FINGERPRINT and no stem — which is exactly what
// `StoredBackups` filters on and what `LatestFingerprint` reads. Recording a
// stem for a run that stored nothing would make the disk figure and the restore
// list both wrong.
//
// ── RETENTION RUNS ONLY AFTER A CHANGE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// An unchanged run added nothing, so there is nothing new to age out. Sweeping
// anyway would be a directory walk and a query per poll on a fleet that is
// behaving.
