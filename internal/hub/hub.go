// Rooms, and the fan-out that uses them.
//
// This is the piece PLAN.md B3 insists must be explicit in Go rather than
// inherited from a library: "Rooms and their authorization role are
// reimplemented explicitly in Go, since room membership is the enforcement
// point, not an optimisation." A socket receives a router's telemetry because
// it is in that router's room, and it is in that room because a permission
// check let it join. Losing that distinction turns a gate into a filter.
//
// Room names match the Node scheme exactly, because the rooms ARE the wire
// contract: buildRouterIo in src/index.js turns a collector's `io.to('page-dns')`
// into `router-<rid>-page-dns`, and this does the same.
//
// BACKPRESSURE IS HANDLED DIFFERENTLY FROM SOCKET.IO, DELIBERATELY. Socket.IO
// buffers without bound for a client that has stopped reading, which on a
// dashboard pushing every second is a memory leak wearing a slow phone as a
// disguise. Here a client that cannot keep up loses FRAMES, not its connection:
// the send is non-blocking and a full queue drops the message. That is safe
// precisely because of how the collectors behave — every payload is a complete
// snapshot rather than a delta, a change re-emits, and opening a page replays
// the last payload — so a dropped frame self-heals on the next tick instead of
// leaving the page permanently wrong. Dropping the connection instead would
// turn a brief stall into a visible reconnect.

// ── SENDING ON A CLOSED CHANNEL PANICS, AND IT KILLED THE PROCESS ──────────
//
// `Remove` closes `Send`, and NOTHING held a lock across the two. `Send` takes
// no hub lock at all, and `Broadcast` releases it before delivering —
// deliberately, so one slow client cannot block the fan-out. So any goroutine
// holding a `*Client` could deliver into a channel that had just been closed,
// and a send on a closed channel is not an error in Go: it panics, unrecovered,
// and the whole server goes down with it — every session, the history recorder,
// the alert dispatcher.
//
// OBSERVED on the operator's install, 2026-09-04:
//
//	panic: send on closed channel
//	  hub.(*Client).deliver          hub.go:78
//	  hub.(*Hub).Send                hub.go:295
//	  server.(*conn).sendRoutersStats  devices.go:656
//	  server.(*conn).startDevicesTick.func1
//
// The Devices page makes it likely rather than special: its refresh fires every
// two seconds from its own goroutine, and `stopDevicesTick` only SIGNALS the
// stop — it does not wait for the tick to leave. A tick already past its select
// and inside `syncPool` (store reads, database queries, sockets closing) is a
// wide window for teardown to run ahead of it. Every other broadcast path has
// the same race with a narrower window.
//
// ── THE WHOLE SEND IS UNDER THE LOCK, AND THAT IS SAFE HERE ────────────────
//
// `Remove` sets `closed` and closes the channel while holding this same mutex,
// so no send can be in flight when the close happens. Holding a lock across a
// channel send would normally be a deadlock waiting to happen; it is not here
// because the send is in a `select` with a `default` and therefore cannot
// block.
