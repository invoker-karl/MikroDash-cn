// ── THIS PANICKED, AND A PANIC HERE IS THE WHOLE PROCESS ───────────────────
//
// `Remove` closed `Send`; `deliver` sent on it; nothing held a lock across the
// two. A send on a closed channel panics rather than erroring, and nothing
// recovers it — so one browser leaving the Devices page could take down every
// session, the history recorder and the alert dispatcher with it.
//
// Observed on the operator's install on 2026-09-04, through the Devices page's
// two-second refresh, which fires from its own goroutine and is only SIGNALLED
// to stop rather than waited for.
