// untraced too: tracing them would produce output the live app never produces,
// continuously, from routers nobody is looking at.
//
// SCANNED ACROSS PACKAGES, not just this file. A first version read `session.go`
// alone, which would have passed with `internal/routers/pool.go` and
// `internal/alertpool/pool.go` each quietly enabling it — and those two are
// exactly the sites where the cost would be continuous rather than per-page.
