// ── THE DEFECT IT REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `probe` asked `if r, ok := any(t).(refresher); ok { r.RefreshNow() }`, where
// `t` is a `collectorTarget` — a struct with no methods. The assertion was
// ALWAYS false, so no dormancy probe has ever refreshed anything: the collector
// was resumed and then waited a full cadence for its answer, which on `wifi`'s
// 300-second subscription is five minutes of a page saying nothing.
//
// Nothing failed, because a resumed collector does eventually report. That is
// the shape this repository keeps losing coverage to, so the fix comes with a
// check — and the check reads the SOURCE rather than a live Session, because
// building one needs a router.
//
// It fails in both directions: a target with no refresh fails, and a refresh
// wired to a method that does not exist fails to compile.

	//
	// This required all 24, which was true while `targetKeys` and the prime list
	// were the same thing. They separated in 3.4: `logs` and `ping` are set B
	// acquisitions with no "take one reading" to ask for, and until then they
	// were kept OUT of the table entirely to avoid this rule — which also meant
	// `applyDemand` could not gate them, so `logs` held a channel per router for
	// a page nobody had open.
	//
	// The property is unchanged and the exceptions are now named rather than
	// avoided. `TestEveryPrimeTargetCanActuallyRefresh` fails a nil that is NOT
	// recorded, and a recording for a key the table does not hold.
