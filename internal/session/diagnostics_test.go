// ── WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The API Diagnostics card is an INSTRUMENT, and the failure mode of an
// instrument is not a crash — it is a plausible wrong number. A card that says
// "4 menus" when eleven are subscribed reads exactly like a card that is right,
// and the first thing an operator does with it is size a poll interval. So each
// figure is asserted against a state built by hand.
//
// It was also, for the whole life of this port, a card that rendered NOTHING and
// looked merely quiet. `internal/verify/event_test.go` recorded that as
// deliberate. So the second job here is to make the emptiness detectable.
