// ── WHY THIS READS THE SOURCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────

// The property is "Release stops everything the connect block started", and it
// is a property of TWO LISTS that sit 200 lines apart in one file. Nothing
// observable distinguishes a stopped collector from an unstopped one on a
// session whose client is already closed — the reads fail either way and nobody
// is listening — which is exactly why the gap survived for most of the port.
//
// So the pin is the same shape as `TestTheBackgroundCollectorCountIsRecorded`,
// which already counts the connect block out of this file: measure both lists
// and compare them, and name the difference when they disagree.

// TestReleaseStopsEveryCollectorTheConnectBlockStarted is the pin.
//
// THE BUG IT WAS WRITTEN FOR: Release stopped dns, bridges, vlans, wan and
// ifStatus — five of the fourteen. The other nine kept their `time.Timer`
// rescheduling forever, because `pollLoop` arms the next tick from inside the
// current one and never asks whether the session is still alive.
//
// ── BOTH TEARDOWN PATHS, NOT JUST Release ─────────────────────────────────
//
// This checked `Release` alone. `Manager.Shutdown` is the other way a session
// ends — SIGTERM — and it had the IDENTICAL defect, still stopping five of
// fourteen after Release was fixed on 2026-08-29. A test naming one function
// cannot see its sibling, and the sibling is the path every container restart
// takes.
// ── RE-AIMED 2026-09-01: THE RELEASE PATH'S TEARDOWN IS NOW `idleOut` ─────
//
// `Release` no longer tears anything down. It decrements the refcount and, when
// the last viewer goes, arms the idle grace; the teardown itself runs in
// `idleOut` when that grace expires with nobody having come back.
//
// So these anchors follow the teardown rather than the name. Pointing them at
// `Release` after the move measured a function that stops nothing and flushes
// nothing -- which is exactly what they reported, and exactly the right
// failure: a check whose subject moves must go red, not quietly pass.
