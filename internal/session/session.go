// Reference-counted, because the thing being conserved is the scarce resource
// the whole project is organised around: "the evidence in #104 points at
// concurrent open channels rather than data volume" (src/collection.js). A
// router with nobody watching it should hold no connection at all, and one with
// six viewers should hold exactly one.

// The dormancy behaviour is deliberately simpler than the Node supervisor's for
// now — this drives one collector — but the shape is the same and the finer
// page gate is already here: a collector runs while its page room has an
// occupant and is suspended when the last viewer leaves.

// INSIDE the collector, so tearing the session down is what makes the dashboard
// charts restart from nothing — the router can be re-read, but the last five

// that mechanism was never ported. So correcting a router's password did not
// reach the connection that was failing on the old one: the session went on
// dialling the stale credential every five seconds, and the only cure was
// restarting the container or deleting the device.
//
// That mattered most at exactly the wrong moment. Issue #124's credential was
// destroyed by a separate bug in `routerUpdate`; the operator's way out is to
// retype the password — and without this, retyping it changed the file and
// nothing else.
