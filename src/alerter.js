 * going down produced ONE alert instead of 501, because everything after the
 * clear read `prev === undefined` and an unknown previous state is not a
 * transition. Then the map refilled from the clear point and the split simply
 * moved. One entry over the line silenced the fleet.
 *
 * NOT A TRIM, and this is the trap. `Map.set` on an EXISTING key does not move
 * it, so insertion order is not recency: an interface that has been present
 * since startup and is re-set on every single pass keeps position 0 forever,
 * while the churning pppoe/l2tp/WireGuard peers that caused the growth sit at
 * the end. An oldest-first trim evicts exactly what must be kept and keeps
 * exactly what should go. Verified rather than assumed.
 *
 * So: prune what is absent from the CURRENT payload. Only that can never
 * forget something still live — clearing forgets everything periodically, and
 * LRU forgets the least-recently-seen, which for a stable fleet is still
 * something real.
 *
 * STILL GATED ON THE BOUND, deliberately. Under STATE_MAX this touches
 * nothing, which matters because a payload is not always the whole fleet:
 * ifstatus:update can carry a provisional snapshot mid-cycle (see
 * interfaceStatus._commitMeta), and pruning against a partial list would drop
 * live state and recreate the very bug. Above the bound that risk is worth
 * taking, because the alternative there is discarding all of it.
 *
 * If more than STATE_MAX entries are genuinely live the map simply stays that
 * size. That is correct: the bound exists to stop CHURN accumulating, not to
 * cap a large fleet, and a real fleet is not a leak.
