# Ask the Go server and the Node app the SAME question and diff the answers.
#
# ── WHY THIS IS NOT IN verify.sh ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# It needs a running Node app, the live /data, and a dashboard login. A gate may
# assume none of those, and one that silently passed when they were absent would
# be worse than no gate — which is exactly what happened to `/api/cities` (see
# the geoip note below). So this is run BY HAND, and what it finds gets written
# down.
#
# ── WHAT IT HAS FOUND ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Two defects in two runs, neither findable by any test in this repo, because a
# round trip through one implementation agrees with itself whatever it wrote:
#
#   2026-08-28  /api/sites sent ""   where the live app sends null
#   2026-08-28  /api/routers sent 11 fields of 23
#
# ── USAGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   MDU=<user> MDP=<password> sh tools/live-diff.sh
#
# The credentials come from the ENVIRONMENT and are never written anywhere. They
# are a dashboard login for the live app; there is no way to derive one, because
# users.json holds scrypt hashes. Ask the operator.
#
# ── THE GEOIP MOUNT IS NOT OPTIONAL ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ── `-no-pool` IS MANDATORY HERE, ADDED 2026-08-29 ──────────────────────────
#
# This starts a THIRD process against the same fleet, and without the flag it is
# standalone — `server.go` builds the background pool from `srv.standalone &&
# !opts.NoPool`, so it would open and HOLD a connection to every enabled router
# while the live app is already watching them. That is the arrangement
# cutover blocker 2 exists to prevent, and it was measured happening for
# most of 2026-08-29: established sockets to 10.0.0.4:8728 and 10.0.0.53:8729
# that nobody had a page open on.
#
# This script is a DIFF of HTTP payloads. It needs no collectors and no pool at
# all — every endpoint it asks reads `/data` or the database.
#
# The comment below about the login being proxied to Node is also stale: with no
# `-node` flag this server is standalone and authenticates against the live
# `users.json` itself. One cookie still works at both, which is what the diff
# needs, but it works for a different reason than it used to.
#
# `--volumes-from mikrodash` shares VOLUMES, and `/app` is image content — so the
# geoip-lite data does not come with it and the Go server reports the city index
# unavailable. That read as "an environment note, not the port" for weeks, and
# the effect was that `/api/cities` and the whole hand-written .dat parser went
# unverified. `docker cp` puts the data where the parser looks; 18 queries then
# came back byte-identical.
