/**
 * What a browser gets WHEN IT ATTACHES TO A SESSION THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING.
 *
 * ---- THE QUESTION NO OTHER CHECK ASKS -------------------------------------
 *
 * The initial-state audit reads the source and asks whether an event is
 * sent on the handshake. This runs the server and asks whether it ARRIVES, on a
 * session whose collectors have already ticked — which is the case the defects
 * of 2026-08-28 all lived in. Socket A opens the session and holds it; socket B
 * attaches later and can only receive these events from a REPLAY.
 *
 * ---- IT WAS CHECKED AGAINST A BINARY WITH THE FIX REMOVED -----------------
 *
 * A probe that passes either way proves nothing. Built with the seven replays
 * disabled, socket B saw:
 *
 *   MISS lan:wan            never arrived
 *   MISS netwatch:update    never arrived
 *   OK   system:update      295ms      OK   talkers:update  524ms
 *   OK   ifstatus:names     600ms      OK   wan:status      942ms
 *   OK   ping:update       1391ms
 *
 * So it discriminates — and the result is more interesting than a clean split.
 * TWO of the seven were genuinely unreachable without the replay, both
 * slow-polling collectors. The other five arrived anyway, because their
 * collectors tick within a second or so.
 *
 * That is still a fix worth having: with the replays every one of the seven
 * arrives in ABOUT 50ms, at attach, deterministically. "Usually shows up inside
 * a second and a half if the collector happens to tick" is not the contract the
 * live app offers, and it is not one a page can be written against.
 *
 * ---- USAGE ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   MDU=<user> MDP=<password> WS_PATH=<path to ws> node tools/attach-probe.js [settle] [window]
 *
 * Hand-run, like `tools/live-diff.sh`: it needs a running Go server on :3097,
 * the live /data, and a dashboard login. Credentials come from the ENVIRONMENT
 * and are never written anywhere.

// `ws` from the app container's node_modules, because this repo has no node
// dependencies of its own — the same arrangement the live-socket-diff tool
// uses, and WS_PATH points at a copy.

// NOT the global `WebSocket`. Node has had one built in since 22, so omitting
// this line does not fail loudly: `new WebSocket(...)` succeeds and returns an
// object with `addEventListener` and no `.on`, and every listener this file
// registers is silently never called. That is exactly what happened when this
// tool was promoted out of a scratch file — the promotion cut the requires, and
// it was not re-run in its final form until the next session tried to use it.
