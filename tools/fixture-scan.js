/**
 * Scan the COMMITTED corpus for values that cannot be tokens this project minted.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY assertClean DID NOT CATCH IT. The capture tool's
 * assertClean is a positive check on KEYS: every value under an identifying key
 * must be a token. That is the right shape for what it guards, and it is blind
 * by construction to a value whose key nobody listed.
 *
 * `testdata/fixtures/.../vpn.json` carried
 * `endpoint-address: "780e06078119.sn.mynetname.net"` — MikroTik's cloud DDNS
 * name, derived from the router's SERIAL NUMBER and resolving to the operator's
 * WAN address. The IP beside it was tokenised into TEST-NET-2 and the hostname
 * was not: the scrubber removed the harmless half and kept the live handle. The
 * operator's own domain and a set of WireGuard public keys were there for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * So this checks the other axis — the SHAPE OF THE VALUE, wherever it sits:
 *
 *   - a hostname under a real public suffix cannot be a token, because every
 *     token this project mints is `<kind>-<hex>` and has no dots;
 *   - a long base64 run is a key of some sort, and keys identify devices.
 *
 * It is deliberately noisy about the second tier — a third-party service name
 * says which services a household uses, which is milder than a DDNS name and not
 * nothing. Each accepted value goes in ALLOWED below, so an acceptance is a
 * decision somebody wrote down rather than a silence.
