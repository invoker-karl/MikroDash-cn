/**
 * A RECONNECT RE-JOINS THE PAGE ROOM.
 *
 * ── THE BUG ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Reported as "the WiFi Clients table goes stale after watching it for a while",
 * and it was not specific to that page — it was every page-scoped card, on any
 * socket that had reconnected. WiFi Clients simply shows it soonest: a 30s poll
 * leaves the longest visible gap.
 *
 * Room membership is per-CONNECTION. A reconnect arrives as a brand-new server
 * `conn` whose `cn.page` is empty, so `rejoinPage` returns immediately; the
 * client re-sends `router:select`, which rejoins the CARDS but has nothing to
 * say about the page. The one thing that could restore it — `page:focus` — was
 * gated on the router id CHANGING, and on a reconnect it has not changed.
 *
 * The browser then sat in no page room at all while the server considered the
 * session healthy and the collector polled into a room nobody was in.
 *
 * ── MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS FIXED ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Driving the real sequence over a WebSocket against the live app on
 * 2026-09-07:
 *
 *   with page:focus            4 wireless:update in 75s
 *   reconnect, select only     0 wireless:update in 75s
 *
 * ── WHY THE TEST IS HERE AND NOT ON THE HANDLER ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The decision used to be three lines inside `main()`, which nothing can import
 * because `main.ts` runs `main()` at module scope. That is why it went unchecked
 * for as long as it did, so the fix moved the decision into `web/src/rejoin.ts`
 * and this asks it directly.
