/**
 * THE STANDARD COLUMN ON THE WIFI CLIENTS TABLE.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT IS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Band says WHICH RADIO a client is on; Standard says WHICH GENERATION it
 * negotiated with that radio. They are orthogonal, and the gap between them is
 * the point: a client reading 5GHz + Wi-Fi 5 on a Wi-Fi 6 access point is not
 * getting Wi-Fi 6, and nothing else on the page would say so. Measured on a live
 * hAP AX3 on 2026-09-07, where a client was doing exactly that (`band=5ghz-ac`).
 *
 * ── DRIVEN THROUGH THE PAGE, NOT THROUGH THE BADGE ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `standardBadge` could be perfectly correct and simply not wired into the row,
 * which is a failure this port has shipped before — "written but never called".
 * So this boots the real page module and feeds it a real `wireless:update`,
 * which exercises the collector's field name, the row builder and the badge in
 * one go. A unit test on the badge alone would pass against a table that never
 * renders it.

// ── THE DISCRIMINATING CASE IS THE UNKNOWN ONE ──────────────────────────────

// With today's vocabulary, alphabetical and ranked order AGREE: "2.4GHz" <
// "5GHz" < "6GHz", and "Legacy" < "Wi-Fi 4" < … < "Wi-Fi 7". So a test built
// only from real values cannot tell a ranked comparator from a `localeCompare`
// one, and would pass against an implementation that breaks the moment MikroTik
// ships a band whose name sorts differently from its frequency.
//
// The empty value is what separates them, and it is not hypothetical: a CAPsMAN
// row carries no band at all and therefore no generation. Alphabetically "" is
// FIRST; ranked, it is last. Every assertion below leans on that.
//
// ONE INTERFACE FOR EVERY CLIENT, deliberately. The table groups by interface
// and only draws group headers when there is more than one, so a single
// interface isolates the comparator from the grouping — which has its own
// ordering behaviour and is not what was reported.
