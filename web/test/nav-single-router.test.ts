/**
 * DEVICES IS VISIBLE ON A ONE-DEVICE INSTALL.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS REPLACES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `applyPageVisibility` used to AND in a fourth term:
 *
 *     const byCount = pageName !== 'devices' || routersMultiple;
 *
 * driven in the live app by `_routers.length > 1` (`public/app.js:7995`). A
 * fleet page was judged meaningless for a fleet of one, so the nav entry simply
 * was not drawn.
 *
 * It was reported as a bug (issue #121) by an operator whose only device was a
 * CHR: no Devices entry until they added a second router. They read it as the
 * app failing to recognise a virtual router, and it was not — the rule never
 * looked at the type, only the count, and any second device would have done it.
 *
 * In the port the rule was already DEAD: its setter lost its last caller when
 * the parity harness went, so the flag stayed true and the term always passed.
 * A gate that reads as live and cannot fire is worse than either behaviour,
 * which is why it was removed rather than rewired.
 *
 * ── WHY A TEST AND NOT JUST A DELETION ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deleting a gate and deleting a CHECK look identical in a diff. This is what
 * makes the difference visible: the behaviour is now asserted, so re-introducing
 * any term that hides Devices fails here rather than shipping.
