/**
 * ADDING A CARD PUTS IT SOMEWHERE FREE.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `findFreeSlot` scanned a fixed 24×22 grid and fell back to 1,1 when nothing
 * fit, on the reasoning that a visible overlapping card beats a silent refusal.
 * Measured on 2026-09-10: the nine cards a default install ships leave 24 free
 * cells of 528, and not one free RECTANGLE big enough for any of the fourteen
 * hidden ones. So the fallback was not the rare case — it was the ONLY case, and
 * every card added from the Add Card panel landed on top of the traffic chart.
 *
 * The grid grows downward now, `ROWS` being its floor rather than its ceiling.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS DRIVEN THROUGH `addCard` AND NOT `findFreeSlot` ───────────────
 *
 * `grid-wiring.test.ts` opens and closes the Add panel and never clicks a chip,
 * so `addCard` had no coverage at all — which is how a placement bug this total
 * survived. Testing the arithmetic alone would have passed against the broken
 * build too, because the arithmetic was doing exactly what it was written to do.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT USES THE SHIPPED LAYOUT, NOT A FIXTURE ───────────────────────
 *
 * The bug is a property of `DEFAULT_LAYOUT`, not of the algorithm in the
 * abstract: on a sparse synthetic grid the old code was already correct. A test
 * on invented cards would have gone green throughout.
