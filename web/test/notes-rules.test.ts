// Moved from the notes-rules check when the port-parity harness was retired.

/**
 * The three client rules upstream recorded with `packages:notes`.
 *
 * `wiring-audit`'s `upd_notes` entry carried them for a day before the event was
 * ported — "three client rules worth taking from upstream rather than
 * rediscovering". This is what took them.
 *
 *   1. ASK ON MODAL OPEN, never on the per-tick update event. The
 *      update-available path fires on every poll, and an unconditional rebuild
 *      there is what made the update strip flash. Nobody who never opens the
 *      dialog should cost a fetch of a third-party URL.
 *   2. DISCARD a reply whose version is not the one on screen, or switching
 *      routers with the dialog open paints the previous router's changelog under
 *      the new router's numbers.
 *   3. ESCAPE BEFORE INSERTION — it is the only third-party content this app
 *      renders into the DOM.
 *
 * Rule 2 is a pure function and is driven directly. Rules 1 and 3 are about
 * WHERE code sits, so they are source checks — anchored on structure, not on a
 * character window.
 *
 *   node tools/notes-rules-check.js
