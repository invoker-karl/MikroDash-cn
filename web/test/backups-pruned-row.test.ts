/**
 * A PRUNED ROW MUST NOT CLAIM TO BE A STORED BACKUP.
 *
 * ── THE REPORT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Keep at most is set to 10, but there are more than 10 backups listed."
 *
 * Retention was working exactly. Measured on the live install: keepCount 10 gave
 * 10 files on disk and 10 unpruned rows, and keepDays 30 correctly removed
 * nothing because every backup was inside the window. The Restore points card
 * read 10 and the Disk used card counted only live rows.
 *
 * The HISTORY table listed 19, and it was right to — it is history, and the nine
 * extra rows are runs whose files retention has since removed. What was wrong is
 * what those nine rows SAID:
 *
 *	RESULT  Stored      ← green badge, and false: it is not stored any more
 *	SIZE    3.3 MB      ← false, and contradicts the Disk used card
 *	ACTIONS pruned      ← the only truthful cell, in the quietest column
 *
 * `outcome` records what the RUN did and never changes afterwards, so a row went
 * on reporting the day it ran. Nine tombstones dressed as backups is not history,
 * it is nine wrong rows — and the arithmetic an operator does at a glance is
 * "count the green badges", which is exactly what produced the report.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS PINS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not the retention arithmetic — that lives in internal/backups and has its own
 * corpus. This pins the CLAIM the table makes about a row whose files are gone.
