/**
 * TWO FROZEN CORPORA THAT HAD OUTLIVED THEIR READERS.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `testdata/bandwidth-rate-cases.json` and `testdata/fa-spectrum-cases.json`
 * were recorded off the Node app and replayed by the port-parity harness. That
 * harness was retired on 2026-09-01 and 25 MB of recordings went with it; these
 * two survived the sweep and then sat unread, because the generators that made
 * them went in the same sweep. Nothing in the tree named either file.
 *
 * Those generators were tools/bandwidth-rate-cases.js and
 * tools/fa-spectrum-cases.js, named here WITHOUT backticks on purpose: the
 * citation check treats a quoted path as a promise that the file exists, and
 * both of these are gone.
 *
 * The obvious move was to delete them with the rest. The reason not to is that
 * the FUNCTIONS they record are still here, still shipping, and had NO test at
 * all — not a weaker one, none:
 *
 *	splitRate             web/src/pages/bandwidth.ts
 *	spectrumTooltipLines  web/src/pages/wireless-fa.ts
 *	spectrumBandGeometry  web/src/pages/wireless-fa.ts
 *
 * So these are not recordings of something that no longer exists. They are
 * forty cases of behaviour this app still implements and nothing checked, and
 * deleting them would have thrown away the only written-down statement of what
 * these three functions do.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is NOT a differential test, and there is nothing left to differ from: the
 * implementation these were lifted from is gone. It is an ordinary table-driven
 * unit test whose table happens to have been generated rather than typed. That
 * is the honest description, and it is why the corpora keep their
 * generated-from field rather than having it stripped to look hand-written.
 *
 * Under CLAUDE.md's rule the surviving claim is "this app agrees with itself",
 * which is weaker than "matches what shipped" — but the table was taken from
 * what shipped, so a regression away from the old behaviour still fails here.
