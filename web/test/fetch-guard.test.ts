/**
 * A 401 must send the browser to the login page.
 *
 * ---- THE DEFECT ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `public/app.js` wraps `window.fetch` as the FIRST thing it does: a 401 in
 * modern auth mode redirects to `/login`, a 403 re-resolves permissions. This
 * port had no equivalent at all.
 *
 * What that cost, reported by the operator on 2026-08-28: with the SPA already
 * open, the server restarted, every in-memory session died, and every request
 * afterwards answered 401. The page sat there — NO LOGIN SCREEN, nothing
 * working. The document was never re-requested, so the server's own 302 on
 * `/next/` never came into it, and `main.ts` catches the `loadRouters()` failure
 * and logs "no routers are readable by this account", which reads as a
 * permissions problem rather than a dead session.
 *
 * ---- WHAT THIS PINS --------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The behaviour, by DRIVING the wrapper — a source check would only prove the
 * file exists. Four cases, and the two that are easy to get wrong are the ones
 * that must NOT redirect:
 *
 *   401 + modern  -> /login
 *   403 + modern  -> refreshCaps, throttled
 *   401 + none    -> nothing (there is no login page to send anyone to)
 *   200           -> nothing, and the response is passed through unchanged
 *
 * Plus the ORDER, which is the half a behaviour test cannot see: the guard must
 * be installed before anything else in `main()`, because a request made before
 * the wrapper is a request whose 401 nobody sees.
 *
