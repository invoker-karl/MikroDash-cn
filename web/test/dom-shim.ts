// THE DOCUMENT SHIM THE WEB TESTS SHARE.
//
// Moved from the shared gate library when the port-parity harness was retired.
// Its body is VERBATIM: every lesson in it (IDL type coercion, ids realised from
// innerHTML, delegated listener recording) is about simulating a browser
// correctly, not about the implementation this app replaced, so none of it went
// stale when that did.
//
// ── WHY IT IS NOT STRICTLY TYPED ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It fabricates node objects that stand in for the DOM. Typing them against
// lib.dom would either be a lie or a very large exercise in describing a
// deliberate approximation, so `web/test/tsconfig.json` relaxes the project's
// strictness for this directory only. The code under test keeps the full rules.

/**
 * THE DOCUMENT SHIM THE PAGE GATES SHARE.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a DOM library. A real one silently normalises markup —
 * reordering attributes, closing tags, lower-casing — and a comparison of two
 * NORMALISED strings can pass while the raw markup differs. These nodes store
 * what was assigned.
 *
 * ── EVERY RULE BELOW WAS A BUG FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Twenty-eight gates each grew their own version of this, each a different
 * subset, and the same three mistakes kept reappearing. They are collected here
 * so the next gate inherits the lessons instead of rediscovering them:
 *
 * 1. THE IDL TYPES ARE ENFORCED. `value` and `title` are DOMString; `checked`
 *    and `disabled` are boolean; so are `textContent` and `innerHTML` (string).
 *    A live page assigning `el('bkKeepCount').value = 10` — a NUMBER — is stored
 *    by a browser as "10". A shim that kept the number reported ALL 42 cases of
 *    the Backups gate as differing against a port that assigns a string. That is
 *    a false failure of the most damaging kind: it looks like a real find, and
 *    acting on it would have "fixed" correct code.
 *
 * 2. IDS INSIDE ASSIGNED innerHTML BECOME REAL NODES. Pages write buttons as a
 *    STRING and then look them up by id to set `disabled`/`textContent`/`title`.
 *    Without this the lookup returns null on BOTH sides, the code no-ops on BOTH
 *    sides, and the gate passes having compared nothing. This is the FALSE PASS
 *    direction and it is the dangerous one.
 *
 *    Two modules in this port write-then-look-up: `backups` and `queues`.
 *
 * 3. DOCUMENT LISTENERS ARE RECORDED so a gate can drive the behaviour a page
 *    actually implements. Selection, tab switching and bulk actions all live on
 *    delegated `document` listeners; a no-op `addEventListener` leaves the gate
 *    seeding one side's internal state by hand, which compares a harness against
 *    an implementation rather than two implementations against each other.
 *
 * 8. `createElement` / `appendChild` exist so a NODE-BUILDING renderer runs to
 *    completion instead of throwing halfway and skipping everything after it in
 *    the same handler. They do NOT model node identity, so anything built that
 *    way must not be COMPARED — only allowed to happen.
 *
 * 7. `children` / `firstElementChild` / `removeChild` work over the stored
 *    markup by a tag-balance scan, so a streaming page's cap
 *    (`while (el.children.length > MAX) el.removeChild(el.firstElementChild)`)
 *    can be driven. It is a scan, not a DOM: top-level elements only, no
 *    comments or unclosed tags.
 *
 * 6. `insertAdjacentHTML` APPENDS, in terms of innerHTML, so a streaming page
 *    that adds one line rather than rewriting the list is drivable. Only the two
 *    positions that appear in this codebase are implemented; an unimplemented
 *    one THROWS rather than silently doing nothing, because a silent no-op here
 *    is a gate comparing two pages that both rendered less than they should.
 *
 * 5. ELEMENT-LEVEL LISTENERS ARE RECORDED, and `node.fire(ev)` dispatches them.
 *    A search box, a select and a button are wired to themselves rather than to
 *    `document`; without this a gate can only reach filter state by poking at a
 *    closure, which is not a comparison of two implementations.
 *
 * 4. A BARE TAG SELECTOR IS ANSWERED, and the cells it returns record their
 *    click listeners. Sort headers are written as a string and then walked to
 *    attach handlers; a shim that returns [] leaves them unwired, so the sort
 *    DIRECTION is never exercised and a mutation ignoring it survives. That was
 *    measured on the DNS gate before this existed.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, and no gate built on it may claim otherwise: layout,
 * focus, computed style, real event dispatch and bubbling, anything that is not
 * one of the properties listed above.
