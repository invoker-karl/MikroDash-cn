// Who may see what: the install's page toggles, this session's role, and the
// capability attributes scattered through the markup.
//
// ── TWO INPUTS, BOTH MUST SAY YES ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A page shows only if the INSTALL allows it and the ROLE grants it. They
// arrive at different times and are stored separately for that reason.
//
// ── UNKNOWN MUST NOT MEAN HIDDEN ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `pageAccess` starts null and the role half is SKIPPED while it is, so the nav
// is not blanked during the first paint. The server denies anything the role
// does not allow regardless, so a briefly-extra nav item is cosmetic — whereas a
// blank sidebar looks broken. The same reasoning runs the other way for
// Settings: `settingsAllowed()` permits while caps are unknown so a genuine
// administrator is not bounced out during the gap, and `applyCaps` re-checks
// once the answer is actually known. That re-check is the other half of the
// bargain and is not optional.
//
// ── CAPABILITY-DRIVEN, NOT ROLE-DRIVEN ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// With three roles and per-router scope, "is this person a viewer?" stopped
// answering "may they press this button" — an operator would have passed the old
// viewer check and then collected 403s. Mark an element `data-cap="…"` and it is
// governed here forever; adding a capability means adding an attribute, not
// editing this file.
