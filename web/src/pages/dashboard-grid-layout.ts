// The Dashboard grid's layout arithmetic: overlap, bounds, free slots and the
// conversions between cells and pixels.
//
// ── PURE, AND SEPARATE FOR THE SAME REASON THE GAUGE WAS ────────────────────
//
// `dashboard-grid.js` is 763 lines of drag handlers, resize handles, an add
// panel and room bookkeeping. This is the part underneath all of it that is
// arithmetic — rects in, rects out — and therefore the part that can be
// compared against the live implementation exactly rather than driven through
// a DOM.
//
// ── THE LAYOUT IS PASSED IN, NOT READ FROM MODULE STATE ─────────────────────
//
// The original's `hasOverlap` and `findFreeSlot` close over a module-level
// `layout`. Here it is a parameter. That is a mechanism change with no
// behavioural one — and it is what lets the gate ask the same question of both
// implementations a few hundred times without rebuilding a page each time.
//
// ── THE MERGE IS DEFAULT-DRIVEN, WHICH IS THE POINT ─────────────────────────
//
// `mergeLayout` walks DEFAULT_LAYOUT and takes the saved entry when there is
// one. So a stored layout from before a card existed still gets that card, at
// its default position, and a stored entry for a card that has since been
// REMOVED is silently dropped. Both matter across an upgrade: the first is why
// a new card appears rather than being invisible until the layout is reset, and
// the second is why a stale id cannot resurrect a card that no longer exists.

 * other therefore does not half-work; it does not work at all, because the
 * server path re-poisons the cache the local path just cleaned. Measured live:
 * the repair was called from `loadLayout` alone and the overlapping card came
 * straight back.
 *
 * So it is one function's job rather than two callers' responsibility. Anything
 * turning stored cards into a layout gets both halves and cannot forget one.

 * ── THE GRID GROWS DOWNWARD, AND `ROWS` IS ONLY ITS FLOOR ──────────────────
 *
 * `ROWS` was a hard ceiling, and a dashboard cannot hold every card in 24×22:
 * the nine cards a default install ships leave 24 free cells of 528, and none
 * of them form a rectangle big enough for ANY of the fourteen hidden ones.
 * `findFreeSlot` therefore always took its fallback and every card added from
 * the Add Card panel landed at 1,1 on top of the traffic chart — not an edge
 * case, the only outcome. Measured 2026-09-10.
 *
 * So the grid extends to cover its deepest card and the page scrolls. `ROWS`
 * stays the FLOOR, which is what keeps an existing dashboard exactly as it is:
 * a layout inside 22 rows returns 22, no track is resized and no card moves.
 *
 * Every place that used to read `ROWS` reads this instead, because a row count
 * that is right in one of them and stale in another is worse than a fixed one:
 * `getCellSize` divides the root's REAL pixel height by it, so a stale count
 * puts a dragged card in the wrong cell.

 * Re-place any visible card that overlaps one before it.
 *
 * ── A ONE-TIME REPAIR FOR LAYOUTS THE OLD `findFreeSlot` DAMAGED ───────────
 *
 * Fixing the placement does nothing for a dashboard that has ALREADY been
 * damaged: the bad position is saved, so an operator who used Add Card before
 * the fix opens their dashboard afterwards and still finds a card sitting on
 * top of the traffic chart, with no idea why. Measured on this dev install.
 *
 * ── AN OVERLAP CAN ONLY HAVE COME FROM THE BUG ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the premise that makes rewriting somebody's saved layout defensible,
 * and it was checked against all three ways a card can move rather than assumed:
 * drag snaps only `if (inBounds(...) && !hasOverlap(...))`, resize returns early
 * on `hasOverlap`, and `doSwap` exchanges position AND size so the two cards
 * trade whole rectangles. None of them can produce an overlap. So a card is
 * moved here only when it was never placed deliberately.
 *
 * The FIRST card of a pair keeps its place and the later one moves, which makes
 * the repair deterministic — and puts the burden on the card the bug added
 * rather than on the one that was already there.
 *
 * ── TWO PASSES, AND THE SECOND ONE IS WHY ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Finding the damaged cards BEFORE moving any of them is what keeps that
 * promise. A single pass re-places a damaged card into the first hole it finds,
 * which can be space an innocent card legitimately occupies later in the list —
 * and then that card is itself found "overlapping" and evicted. Caught by
 * mutation testing: A(1,1,12x11) B(13,1,12x11) C(1,1,10x6 stacked)
 * D(1,12,24x11) moved D, which nothing was wrong with, and left the dashboard
 * 33 rows long instead of 28.
 *
 * So pass one decides who is damaged and pass two moves only those, treating
 * every undamaged card as an obstacle wherever it stands. A damaged card's own
 * position is never an obstacle — it is about to move, and reserving it would
 * lengthen the page for space nobody will use.
