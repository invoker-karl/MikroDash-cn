// The Dashboard's traffic chart — the last of the seven cards.
//
// ── IT DRAWS ON PINNED ARITHMETIC ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every formula this file needs lives in `dashboard-traffic-buffer.ts` and is
// compared against the live expressions there. What is left here is the parts
// that touch Chart.js and the DOM: the config, the redraw, the static-tick
// plugin and the 60fps keepalive.
//
// ── THE KEEPALIVE IS WHY THE CHART LOOKS ALIVE BETWEEN SAMPLES ──────────────
//
// Samples arrive at 1 Hz. If the axis only moved when one landed, the chart
// would jump once a second. Instead a rAF loop advances the X axis against the
// ESTIMATED SERVER TIME every frame, and the sample handler only appends data.
// Both use the same anchor formula, so the first frame after a redraw continues
// exactly where the redraw painted rather than snapping sideways.
//
// It throttles itself to ~30fps (`now - lastTickMs < 33`) and bails entirely
// when the tab is hidden, the router is down, or the socket is disconnected —
// so a backgrounded tab costs nothing and a dead router's chart stops advancing
// instead of scrolling away from its last data.
//
// ── AND THE FADE EXISTS TO HIDE A CATCH-UP, NOT TO LOOK NICE ────────────────
//
// On hide the canvas is set to opacity 0. While hidden the keepalive is off, so
// when the tab comes back the axis is stale by however long it was away and the
// first frames jump forward to catch up. The fade covers exactly that: commit
// opacity 0 with no transition, force a reflow so the browser registers a real
// 0→1 change rather than collapsing it, then fade in once the axis has settled.
