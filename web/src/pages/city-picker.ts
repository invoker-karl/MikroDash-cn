// `place` of null as "clear the override". So a modal wired WITHOUT this picker
// would send null on every save and **wipe an operator's manual location each
// time they edited anything else about the router**. The picker is not the last
// piece of the modal; it is a precondition for wiring it at all.

 * before there was a second caller to justify a shared one. This function is the
 * shared one, and the SITE FORM uses it; `router-modal.ts` still has its own.
 *
 * That duplication is deliberate for exactly one reason: the modal's picker
 * wiring is NOT differentially gated — `city-picker-check.js` covers the state
 * machine below, not the fetch, the debounce or the list. Migrating it would be
 * an ungated refactor of working code, which is a worse trade than two copies
 * with the divergence written down. **The migration is the follow-up**, and when
 * it happens this comment goes with it.

 * The one modal-specific thing kept OUT of here is its test gate's
