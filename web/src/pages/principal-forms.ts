/**
 * What the User, Group and Role forms DECIDE — separated from what they touch.
 *
 * ── THREE FORMS THAT LOOK ALIKE AND ARE NOT ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `saveUser`, `saveGroup` and `saveRole` sit within three hundred lines of each
 * other in `public/app.js` and read almost identically. They differ in six ways,
 * every one of which is invisible until it is wrong:
 *
 *  1. THE REQUIRED-FIELD MESSAGE. "Username required" for the user form and
 *     "Name is required" for the other two — not one shared string.
 *  2. THE FALLBACK MESSAGE. 'Save failed', 'Could not save the group', 'Could
 *     not save the role'. Three different ones, each shown when the server sent
 *     no `error`.
 *  3. WHICH FIELDS ARE TRIMMED. The user form trims the id; the other two do
 *     not. All three trim the name. NONE trims the password.
 *  4. THE PASSWORD IS OMITTED WHEN EMPTY, rather than sent as "". That is the
 *     client half of the server rule that an empty password means "leave the
 *     credential alone" — send `""` and the account is re-hashed on every edit.
 *  5. THE GROUP FORM CHECKS THE HTTP STATUS TOO — `r.ok && j.ok`, where the
 *     other two look only at `j.ok`. A 500 with an `ok`-less body reads as a
 *     failure there and could read as success on the other two.
 *  6. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A SUCCESSFUL CREATE. The group and role forms close.
 *     The USER form stays open and switches to edit mode, and the live comment
 *     says why: "A new user has no id until now, so the grant editor had nothing
 *     to attach to. Rather than making them reopen the form, switch it to edit
 *     mode on the returned record and render the editor in place."
 *
 * Splitting the decision out is what lets the principal-forms check drive
 * these and the live functions from one harness and compare — the DOM half needs
 * a browser, and this half needs nothing.

 * The live comment on it: "Read the matrix back out of the DOM — the segmented

 * carries `sbtn-primary` IS the answer, and this turns the levels that reading
 * produced into the rows the server wants.
 *
 * ── "none" IS OMITTED, NOT SENT ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A page set to None produces no row at all, which is what makes the whole
 * matrix a REPLACEMENT: the server takes the list as the complete set, so a page
 * that is absent is a page the role does not confer. Sending `access: 'none'`
 * would be rejected outright — `ParseRolePages` accepts only read and write.
 *
 * A row whose segmented control has NOTHING selected reads as `none` on the live
 * side (`on ? ... : 'none'`) and is therefore dropped. That is not a state the
 * UI can reach, but it is what the code does, so it is what this does.
