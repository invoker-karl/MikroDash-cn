/**
 * The Settings page — the read half.
 *
 * ── ONLY THE READ HALF, AND THE REASON IS THE OTHER PROCESS ────────────────
 *
 * `POST /api/settings` is not wired and will not be until cutover: the live
 * `settings.js` caches the whole settings object at first load and never
 * re-reads the file, so a write from this side is invisible to the running Node
 * app AND is silently reverted by its next save. See internal/server/settings_api.go.
 *
 * So this fills the form and nothing else. The form is the part that has to be
 * right on day one anyway — a field populated from the wrong default is a
 * setting the operator "changes" to the value it already had, or worse, saves
 * away without noticing.
 *
 * ── THE FIELD TABLE IS GENERATED ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `web/src/gen/settings-form-map.ts` comes from the live `populate()` via
 * The settings-form-map tool. ~100 inputs, and three defaults for an absent
 * value that look identical on screen when the setting IS set:
 *
 *   checkOn   `data[f] !== false`  — ABSENT MEANS ON
 *   checkOff  `!!data[f]`          — absent means off
 *
 * Every page toggle is `checkOn`. Porting them as `checkOff` would hide every
 * page on a fresh install, and nothing about the code would look wrong.
