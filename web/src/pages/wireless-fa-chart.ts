/**
 * The Frequency Analyser's spectrum CANVAS.
 *
 * ── THIS IS GLUE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every decision belongs to `wireless-fa.ts` and is gated there: `spectrumConfig`
 * and `spectrumData` against the live `makeChart` (the fa-chart check),
 * the tooltip body and the band geometry (the fa-spectrum check). What is
 * left — and what stayed unported longest — is constructing a Chart.js instance
 * against an element and registering a plugin. That needs a browser and a
 * charting library rather than a decision, which is why it is here and why it is
 * thin.
 *
 * ── IT NEVER STARTS A SCAN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Worth stating plainly, because the item this closes is the one carrying the
 * warning: a spectral scan takes a radio OFF THE AIR and drops every client on
 * it. That is `/interface/wireless/spectral-scan`, issued by the scan button and
 * the server; nothing in this file asks for one. It draws rows that have already
 * arrived.
