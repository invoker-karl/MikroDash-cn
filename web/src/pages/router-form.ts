// a stored router becomes form values, and how form values become a stored
// router. Both directions are pure, so both are comparable against the original
// without a browser.

 * input holds integers and 1.5 would not survive the round trip.

 *    `auto` as "keep what you learned", so sending one would let a save race the
 *    background geo refresh and discard what it found.
 *
 * 2. **AN EMPTY COLLECTOR GRID OMITS THE WHOLE `collection` BLOCK.** The grid is
 *    fetched, so it can still be empty when the modal has only just opened — and
 *    an empty grid yields `off: []`, which the server reads as "enable
 *    everything" and which would WIPE the router's disabled collectors.
 *    `undefined` means "keep what is stored", which is what is meant. This is
 *    the difference between saving a form early and silently re-enabling every
 *    collector an operator had switched off.
 *
 * 3. **`connDownThresholdSec` is clamped to 0..300, falling back to 30.** An
 *    empty box parses to NaN and `NaN >= 0` is false, so it takes the default —
 *    while an explicit 0 passes, because 0 means "no debounce" and is a value an
 *    operator can legitimately want.
 *
 * The password is the one string NOT trimmed: leading or trailing whitespace in
 * a password is part of the password.
 *
 * `mode` is passed through verbatim — see the assignment for why the original's
 * `'stream'` fallback is not an empty-value default.
