// The Dashboard grid's persistence, its application to the DOM, and its room
// bookkeeping.
//
// ── STORAGE IS TWO PLACES, AND THEY ARE NOT EQUALS ──────────────────────────
//
// `localStorage` is the one that is READ. The server copy is written on every
// save and read only at init, so a browser that has a cached layout uses it
// immediately and the server's copy exists to follow the operator to another
// machine. Losing the POST loses portability; losing localStorage loses the
// layout on this machine until the next fetch.
//
// The save is therefore ordered: localStorage FIRST, then the network. A failed
// POST must not cost the local layout.
//
// ── EVERY READ FAILURE STARTS CLEAN, DELIBERATELY ───────────────────────────
//
// A parse error, a private-mode `localStorage` that throws, a blob that is not
// an array, an EMPTY array: all of them fall through to the defaults.
//
// The `length > 0` and `Array.isArray` guards are BELT AND BRACES rather than
// load-bearing, and measuring said so: removing either changes nothing, because
// `mergeLayout` walks DEFAULT_LAYOUT and produces the defaults for an empty list
// anyway, and a non-array makes its `for...of` throw into the same catch. They
// are reproduced because the original has them and they state the intent — they
// are not what protects the dashboard.
//
// ── TWO CARDS CAN SHARE A ROOM ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `syncDashRooms` is the piece with teeth: it decides which page-gated
// collectors run. It dedupes by ROOM rather than by card, so a room is joined
// once however many of its cards are visible. The corollary is the dangerous
// half — leaving a room must be a decision about whether ANY visible card still
// wants it, never about the one card that was just removed.
//
// ── AND `/api/dashboard-layout` IS NOT A GO ENDPOINT ────────────────────────
//
// It is unprefixed, so it reaches Node through the proxy, which serves it from
// the same SQLite the port would read. That is the same arrangement
// `/api/nav-prefs` and `/api/topology-layout` are in, and it is recorded in
// the port record as a cutover item rather than a gap: during coexistence it
// works, and duplicating it in Go before cutover would mean two writers.
